# Hacking

As a concept, hacking can be done to **devices** and **networks** utilizing an action roll and a **terminal**. By making clever use of the tools the terminal provides, hackers can bypass **ICE** - Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics, or to put simply, programs made to stop hackers.

## Devices

Anything that can be **controlled** by a computer, or the computer itself, either remotely or locally. All devices are either **isolated** or exist on a **network**.

_When connected to a device_, a hacker can connect to and gain full control of the device by making a **wits** action roll against the device's or network's ICE. Consequences for failure include premature detection, network lockouts and counter-attacks. Hackers can attempt connection to devices via physical cables, ports or by **spying on a connection** inside a network.

## Networks

As the name implies, a network of connected devices. Either through **remote connections** through WiFi, Radio, lasercoms, etc. or through **physical connections**, such as fiber optics. A device can freely communicate with any other connected device, so long as this connection has no restrictions, such as a firewall. The internet, for example, is a global network of devices, where _servers_ have some restrictions and _clients_ - users who do the connecting - have many.

_When spying on a connection_, a hacker can attempt to hack both other devices in the connection, without needing physical access to the device itself. They also do not need to hack the connection itself.

## Security

ICE is the main form of digital security, and it works by:

- **Restricting connections** between devices;
- **Deploying counter-measures** against hackers;

ICE may place protection of _both_ remote connections, physical connections, or neither. It may also provide different levels (0 to 3) of protection, with each adding _thorns_ equal to its level to any hacking attempt in the protected device or network.

- **Network ICE** protects all _remote connections_ in a network.
- **Device ICE** protects both _remote and physical connections_ for a given device.

_Any ICE, once bypassed and until it is replaced, is no longer effective._ A device may have both device-level and network-level ICE, in which case both need to be surpassed before the hacker can gain access to the device.

Often, weaker networks will have only their exposed devices be protected by device ICE, and everything else be protected by network ICE. This means that a successful attack against the exposed device will strip all other devices of their protection, as the network ICE - their only safety net - has been bypassed and is thus no longer effective.

### Countermeasures

If a hacker is caught or makes a fatal mistake, regular ICE often either blocks the offending terminal from ever connecting to the network again, or temporarily increasing its security level, or both, and stricter ICE may remove the targetted device from the network entirely.

However, more often than not, hackers make inocuous mistakes that allow them to be traced, or at the very least, alert system administrators of their presence.

**Black ICE** employs more destructive countermeasures by counter-hacking the terminal itself - bricking it, inducing overheating, stealing data or, in the case of **biodigital terminal cyberware**, attacking the hacker directly by frying their interface.
