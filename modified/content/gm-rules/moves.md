# Moves

**_The rules that you, the GM, play by_**. While reality is whimsical, it still has its rules. Use these moves to twist and shape in response to the players:

- **_Tension moves_** help the players out in some way **or** escalate the situation. **_Generate tension when used._** _Make these moves with good timing._
- **_Impact moves_** deal significant consequences, crank up the danger, and make the world feel powerful. _Make these moves when prompted._

## Prompt

A trigger for you to make an impact move, caused by things like grim or messy action rolls, a relevant depleted pool, unaddressed foreshadowing, or by spending tension.

## Tension

When PCs ride the synchronicity freeway, they don't do so at no cost - **_Twisting reality builds tension_**. While players require _fate_, as GM, you are empowered to do so as you please with **tension moves**. In any case, you **generate tension** when reality is manipulated in these ways, and you can spend tension at any time to _prompt an impact move._ When making moves, always remember to...

## Keep The Story Moving

While _tension moves_ and _impact moves_ allow you to play at (and as) the world, remember that you are building a narrative as a group - and a cinematic one at that. Player actions drive the story, and **story moves** nudge them forward. That doesn't mean the world is passive — you can describe anything happening that makes sense. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, it's more satisfying when the players have **_fair warning_** about trouble. They know actions have consequences and built-up tension will come back to bite them. This feels fair, so outside of these you give them the initiative. It shows things aren't arbitrary — **_the GM is also playing the game, just by different rules_**.

### Foreshadow

**Hint at trouble, sometimes with a timer pool. Prompts a later impact move.**

_Foreshadow_ to signal upcoming threats and give the players a chance to react. This is a great way to introduce adversity when you don't have or want to spend tension. If they fail to deal with it or ignore the danger, it prompts an impact move and the pace of the story picks up.

### Question

**Ask provocative questions to stir up drama or flesh out the world.**

_Question_ players to help suss out what kind of story they're interested in, share the creative load, and keep the story fresh for yourself. Try to keep this focused on their character's perspective, but feel free to dip into the meta channel here and talk directly as players about what you all want to see play out in game.

### Set The Scene

**Use a tension roll to determine how a scene starts off when it’s unclear.**

_Set The Scene_ when you're unsure about the specifics of the current fiction or want to dive straight into the action. Skip detailed planning and cautious leadups that often drag gameplay down. Instead, jump straight into the action, an in medias res shot of things already in motion! The roll sets the opening mood and stakes for the scene. On a 6, it can even trigger an impact move, kicking things off with a bang and raising the suspense right away.

### Spotlight

**Focus attention on a PC, encouraging them to act or follow-up.**

_Spotlight_ PCs to help direct the action, ensure no one is left out, and put focus where it's needed. This prompts players towards action. Mix in cinematic language like "We cut to..." or "The camera pans over to show..." as you use the "camera", your group's shared imagination space. Cut back and forth between PCs and scenes to build tension and avoid focusing on a single PC for too long.

### Wrap It Up

**Call for a montage roll or jump to a likely conclusion to a scene.**

_Wrap It Up_ when a scene has served its purpose, grown stale, or feels like a foregone conclusion. Don't waste game time on these. Closing these scenes out decisively keeps the narrative tight and focuses on what's next.

## Hit With Impact

### Consequences

What happens when things go wrong — from failed rolls, timers, or impact moves. They should feel **_hard but fair_**, reflecting the stakes and severity of the situation. Every roll carries risk; otherwise, assume success and move on.

Damage is a solid baseline: in a fight, injuries leave you bloodied by default. Other consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There’s no strict formula — _it’s a gut feeling_. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction its teeth.

### Splitting It

Breaking big consequences into smaller ones. Multiple effects can be just as effective and make more sense in the situation. You might break up bloodied into a few marks, or rattled becoming vex and rolling a pool instead. Splits make the story move in multiple directions.

### Spreading It

Hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who didn't prompt the move. Consequences can be identical, vary in severity, or differ entirely. If a PC other than the one prompting it is hit, they get a defense roll. Spreads make the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.

### Thinking Offscreen

Fallout that happens beyond the immediate action. Not all consequences need to occur in the spotlight. Hitting elsewhere builds suspense, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. These unseen events make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.

### Using Pools

Building pressure with danger or timer pools. Start or roll a danger or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often **_offscreen_**. These create looming threats and situations the PCs want to avoid or mitigate. They build pressure and offer a strong alternative to skipping the move and generating tension.

### Setting Risk

Framing danger when it's not the default. Most rolls assume meaningful consequences. Declaring high risk before a roll or situation signals severe stakes—death or worse looms. Low risk shifts outcomes into lighter territory, rolling for things you'd normally skip, with softer consequences. It's a tool for tone, moving between intense and light play.

### Leave It To Fate

Sometimes, shit happens. To avoid delegating such unfortunate circumstances, make a _tension roll_ and interpret the results. On a messy or grim, you can use the dropped dice to spread the consequences and/or as an indication of severity.

### Skiping It

When nothing comes to mind, skip the impact move and generate tension instead! You can also skip impact moves by prompt of a talent, _Lucky Breaks_, etc. In any case, whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you **build tension**, and **you must add the skipped impact move to the crew's entanglement table**.

## Tension Roll

The GM rolls the tension pool to delegate a decision to pure luck:

- **6**: The characters get as unlucky as needed to muck their plans. _Propmts an impact move_.
- **4/5**: The characters avoid a disaster, but there still minor consequences.
- **1-3**: The characters get a lucky break.

In the case of a 6, use the amount and distribution of dropped dice to determine the severity of the impact move and its consequences, as well as how to split it amongst PCs.
