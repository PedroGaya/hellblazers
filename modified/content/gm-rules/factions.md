# Factions

Between sessions, track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:

- **Resources** that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and capital.
- **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a **faction pool**, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events (impact moves) in the story.
- **Agendas** that represent their ambitions and philosophy, as well as **representatives** that embody and push these agendas.
- **Tiers** that abstract the scale of their power and influence.

Keep 4-6 active factions, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals. Replace factions that are no longer relevant to the story.

## Faction Turn

Once per session, but between sessions, the GM resolves a **faction turn**. Each faction at play gets to make as many faction moves as its tier, simultaneously.

## Faction Moves

### Make A Play

To make a play, for any given faction, roll **any faction pool at play**, so long as it's not a secret one - Factions can not only advance their goals, but support other factions in theirs as well. Instead of rolling, the faction may also use this move to set as many goals as they want.

When a faction pool depletes, the goal is either accomplished or they make their move against another faction, with a montage roll in their favor determining how it plays out. Goals can be anything from stealing/destroying an asset or setting up further action by dropping dice from other pools.

### Acquire An Asset

Spend **faction resources** to gain new assets, expanding the faction's vantage or providing special abilities. Alternatively, they may spend (10 \* 2^New Tier) resources to consolidate power and increase in tier.

### Defend Or Delay

Add a die to **any other faction pool at play**, delaying it.

### Collect

The faction gains as many resources as its tier, plus one.

## Campaign Pools

Timers that pace long-term events across sessions. They work like faction pools but donâ€™t require faction details. Use them to signal upcoming events or remind you to reintroduce plotlines.
