# Hacking

As a concept, hacking can be done to **devices** and **networks** utilizing an action roll and a **terminal**. By making clever use of the tools the terminal provides, hackers can bypass **ICE** - Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics, or to put simply, programs made to stop hackers.

The hacking roll one of _wits_, and starts with up to _4t_, **depending on ICE level**. These thorns can be lost by accumulating _advantages_:

- Having proper vantage;
- Using good hardware;
- Special daemons and programs;
- Talents or special abilities;

Each advantage applies only once per category (no double dipping).

## Operations

Sometimes, hacking a system is an on-going effort (like in heist movies). Start a diminishing pool of any size and drop one dice per advantage, then make action rolls to trigger the pool until it is cleared and the op is done.

The difficulty for each action roll in an operation is determined as with regular hacks, but the worst result in any such roll "sticks" as the overall result for the operation.

## Intrusions

ICE is the main form of digital security, and it works by:

- **Restricting connections** between devices;
- **Deploying counter-measures** against hackers;

ICE may place protection of _both_ remote connections, physical connections, or neither. It provides different levels (1 to 4) of protection, with each adding _thorns_ equal to its level to any hacking attempt in the protected device or network.

## Countermeasures

_Any ICE, once bypassed, is no longer effective._ However, **regular ICE** evolves over time - once some time has passed, the program _learns_ from the hack and increase its security level. _Succesful_ hacks and ops avoid this by being stealthy.

**Black ICE** works the same, but employs more destructive countermeasures by counter-hacking the offending device itself - glitching it, inducing overheating, stealing data or, in the case of **biodigital terminal cyberware**, attacking the hacker directly by frying their interface.

## Electronics

Both **devices** and **(sub) networks** of devices can be hacked. Hackers can use their hacking terminal to access devices remotely, so long as they're both in the same network or connected physically. Hacking a network grants access to all devices within it, but usually requires an _operation_.

Isolated devices are usually connected to each other or command centers through physical connection lines, forming a completely isolated sub-net. This necessitates on-premise access for hacks.
