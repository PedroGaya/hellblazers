# Core Rules

## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the outcome - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim result is cut by a **_thorn_**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster. Thorns go from 0t (tough task) to 3t (impossible task).

## Fate

_**Fate** represents your character's capacity to ride the synchronicity freeway._ It's a d6, you can have up to three at a time, and can **spend** them to:

- _**Get +1d on a roll**_ - To account for supernatural effort, _protagonist power_;
- _**Introduce a fact** to the fiction as a **story twist**_ - Something that just happened to be true and that affects the scene;
- _**Cheat death**_ - Avoid an instance of **severe damage** (becomes regular).

## Tension

A shared **diminishing pool** of dice representing accumulated bad karma. **Add 1d to the tension pool whenever fate is spent.**

**The GM can spend a tension die to prompt an impact move at any time**.

## Working Together

### Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and **bonds** as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take tension instead.

### Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

### Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

### Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

## Dice Rolls

### Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, clarifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a **defense roll** against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls.

### Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

### Montage Roll

Roll 2d to abstract a scene into a montage. The results determine how well it goes.

### Tension Roll

The GM rolls the tension pool to delegate a decision to pure luck, using the amount of dropped dice to guide the fiction (can be both). In general, results are unfavorable to the players, proportional to how many dice were dropped.

## Diminishing Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When **triggered**, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

- **Timer Pool**: Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.
- **Danger Pool**: Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.
- **Task Pool**: Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.
- **Resource Pool**: Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.
- **Power Pool**: The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect** - You can also always drop the last die in a task pool.

# Creative Freedom

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?. **Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Your vantage can expand or diminish along the scale. These shifts are called **_advantages_** and **_disadvantages_**, respectively.

- Guaranteed - Given - Stretch - Reach - Impossible
- Always - Should - Could - Scarcely - Never

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. **Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage is set dressing**; Like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense. Similarly, **any details that do not significantly shift vantage are set dressing**.

There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing.

## Story Twists

If you want introduce story details to the fiction that go beyond set dressing, you want to introduce a **_twist_**:

### Complications

Character-driven **disadvantages** you add to a scene and have to follow-up on. They must stem from your character details and always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unforeseen consequences_** of your actions.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Trouble_** from beliefs or backstory.

**Whenever you introduce a complication, drop a tension die and take it as fate**.

### Coincidences

Character-driven **advantages** you add to a scene. Like with complications, these must be tied to your character. These are things like:

- **_Character details_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene details_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting details_**: History, geography, factions...

**To introduce a coincidence, spend fate and add it to the tension pool**.
