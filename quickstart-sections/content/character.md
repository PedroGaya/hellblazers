# Character Creation

Characters start with two life paths - Each includes six professions, granting unique stats and wises. Turning points tell you how you left the first path for the second, then finally how you left the second and found your crew.

## Upbringing

- **Age**: Start at 16 y/o.
- **Stats**: Start with 1 in each.
- **Social Class**: Roll 2d, pick one and increase its indicated stats.
- **Birthplace**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources and Lifestyle**: Set them as indicated by your social class.

## Life Paths

- **Path**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Profession**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources**: Add the listed amount to your character sheet.
- **Lifestyle**: Modify it by the indicated amount.
- **Stats**: Increase indicated stats by one.
- **Wises**: Note down your three wises, or create your own.
- **Equipment and Cyberware**: Spend your resources to buy what you want _and_ what is **required** of you.
- **Age**: Roll 3d, choose 2 to add to age.
- **Turning Point**: Roll 2d, pick one.

Repeat for the second life path.

### Debts

During character creation, you may be required by certain professions to have certain pieces of cyberware or expensive equipment. Of course, **you have to pay for these**. If you can't, choose a different profession or work with your GM to create a debt-holder NPC, then add a **debt** bond to your character sheet to acquire what you need.

## Finishing Up

- **Talents**: Choose one whose pre-requisites you meet.
- **Age**: Roll 2d and choose one or both to add to your age, representing your time before finding a crew.
- **Traits**: Choose three that match your character and two that don't at all.
- **Features**: Detail three distinctive outward features of your character.
- **Bonds**: Write or roll one for each PC.
- **Beliefs**: Write at least one and up to three.
- **Resistances**: Each is a diminishing pool of size equal to the sum of its paired stats.

## Archetypes

Instead of building a character from the ground up, you can use an **archetype**. Each has specific rules on how to create your character, and they all output a character of a certain kind. If you just want to quickly build _a type of guy_, choose the appropriate archetype.

# Character Details

## Fate

Whenever you spend fate to get bonus dice, cheat death or introduce coincidences, add it to the tension pool. You can earn fate in the following ways:

- **Introduce a complication**: As seen above. In this case, take a tension die as fate.
- **Change your character details**: Take fate whenever:
  - When you complete a personal objective or see your outlook change, **changing a belief**;
  - **Shift a bond** in an envolving relationship with a PC;
  - **Take a scar** due to fallout;
  - etc.
- **Roll a disaster**: Take fate whenever you roll a disaster.
- **Hit a crew XP trigger**: When a trigger is hit, all characters take fate.

## Background

Your upbringing and life paths - the core of your vantage. Each path gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage, as well as a profession to call your own.

## Traits

Use your background to choose 3 that strongly define you and 2 that definitely don't.

## Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

## Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart.

## Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 4/_excellent_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

## Resistances

A character's health is abstracted into two different resource pools, one for **physical resistance** and one for **mental resistance**. Their size is each equal to the sum of their corresponding paired stats.

## Bonds

Your dynamic with other characters. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other character, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes fate_**.

Bonds can also be made with NPCs. **When you form a bond with an NPC, _take fate_**. Relationships with NPCs don't need an intensity or nature - you may simply note the type of relationship you have, as well as their name. For example, you may have a debt-holder bond to a loan shark.

## Beliefs

Written statements of your characters ambitions or goals, doubling as your priorities as a player for this character. Write at least one and up to three.

Beliefs are fluid, actionable and tied to the situation at hand, as well as your character details. As goals are achieved and your character changes, so will your beliefs. **_When you resolve a belief, take fate_** then write a new one.

# Experience

## Post-Session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level _(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)_. This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** _(about 1 in 4)_. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it (also applies to crew XP).

## Vote XP

During **downtime**, players can vote on characters to earn bonus XP. To earn those votes, roleplay towards your beliefs, traits, features, etc. and overall contribute to an enjoyable session.
