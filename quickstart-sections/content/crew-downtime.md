# Crew

## Crew Creation

Choose an archetype from:

- Occult Investigators
- Shady Cult
- Cyber-Terrorists
- Illegal Gas-Biker Gang
- Scrappy Losers Stuck Together

Each provides a procedure for setting it up. In general:

- **Triggers**: Choose four XP triggers from your crew type, or write your own.
- **Improvements**: Choose as two from the list provided by your crew type. Also pick a place for your lair.
- **Reputation**: Determine your starting reputations based on improvements and lair.
- **Special Ability**: Choose one from your crew type.

## Triggers

Four evocative phrases which determine how the crew gains XP. Usually set by the chosen crew type. When triggers are hit, mark them as so and each character takes fate.

## Improvements

Assets that can be purchased with resources. Represent better shared equipment and lair - it's material goods. Overall, they improve downtime activities and defend the crew from adversity due to entanglements.

## Reputation

Ranging from -3 to +3, with escalating benefits and consequences. At -3, you're at **war** and enter a **crisis**. At +3, they'll help you out in this war.

## Entanglements Table

Some consequences are only felt later. They are registered in your crews **entanglements table**, representing all manner of things that can happen to you during downtime. Managed by the GM.

## Special Abilities

You work better together; Your special abilities determine _How?_, and should match your group's fantasy of _excelence_. What does your success as a group look like? Your special abilities help you get there.

# Downtime

While players work on **downtime activities** spread over **cycles**, the GM deals with the entanglements table and factions. When everyone is done with their downtime activities, or if otherwise prompted, free play begins once again.

A downtime cycle refers to the minimum amount of leisure time available for PCs to engage with activities. Activities take an amount of time measured in cycles, **not actual time**. The length of time available in a cycle should be settled on by the group. By default, a handful of days, so that there are two cycles in a week. In play, the standard downtime phase amounts to **two cycles**.

## Entanglements

The GM makes a _tension roll_ where each dropped dice **prompts an impact move from the entanglements table**. Entanglements describes a thing that happens to the crew – some thugs annoy you, the cops come to interrogate you or other mistakes come running back. The GM may also spend tension to choose a move from the table and prompt it immediately.

The GM may bring any one these moves into play immediately, hold them off until appropriate or make them as **faction moves** (so long as they're made against the players). In any case, if the prompted moves are not dealt with by the end of downtime, then the GM banks them as tension.

Once prompted by the table, these moves cannot be skipped. The GM decides whether or not to cross them out from the table once resolved - some events only make sense as a one-time occurence, while cops being annoying is an all-the-time worry.

### Editing The Table

Every table starts with a predetermined set of events by the crew type, and there are two ways of editing it:

- **Skipping Impact Moves**: Whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you may add it to an empty slot in the table, or if full, replace an old entry.
- **Spend Tension**: Immediately add an impact move to the table. Do this at any time during free play, or during downtime but before any rolls are made.

Don't attempt to add an entire scene as an entry - keep it punchy. List the move's name and a simple evocative description. Entaglements are not the whole story, they're narrative seeds sowed at the table, reaped only when rolled or otherwise prompted again.

## Activities

As soon as downtime starts, clear all marks and burned fate slots, roll all healing pools and reset per-session talents and special abilities. Then, each player goes about as many activities as available to them.

- **Recover**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise unwind. Recover dice to physical resistance equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Acquisition**: Peruse and purchase _improvements_ or _equipment_ not covered by your lifestyle rating.
- **Commune**: Shared time with the crew. Spend all xp, clear triggers, and run _character votes_. Recover all mental resistance.
- **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool according to the size of the work, as well as determining what happens when cleared. Roll it when working.
- **Contact**: The GM makes tension roll to create an NPC according to the player's needs and vantage.

## Crisis

During times of **crisis**, the amount of available cycles is halved. Crisis can be entered as an extreme consequence or when at war with a faction (-3 rep).
