# Equipment

You're assumed to own the **tools** and have the skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**.

## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

## Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's investments or other signifiers of income. To increase it, spend your resources in **assets**, such as expensive equipment or a home. Each increases your lifestyle rating by one.

| Lifestyle | Affordable Stuff                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | A shot of shitty liquor. Food for a day.    |
| 1         | Rent in a shanty town. Minor amenities.     |
| 2         | Out-of-date smartphone. Home repairs.       |
| 3         | Short trips. Black market firearms.         |
| 4+        | Rent in the good side of town. Investments. |

## Loadout

Loadout is a means of changing your vantage by way of specific pieces of gear. Characters have five **loadout slots**, two of which are occupied by each of your profession's given tools, if any.

Each equipment slot is used for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of heavy weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might change your capabilities for any reason. Some particularly annoying to carry items may occupy two slots instead of one.

Items that do not affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just take note of them in your character sheet.

## Cyberware

Each character has **five slots** for installing cyberware. Like with equipment, each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots proportional to its impact on the body - one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**.

### Neurodrugs

Neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity** and allow for cyberware installation. can be viciously addicting. If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to neurodrug abstinence), the user starts **crashing out**.

### Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

The first stage usually lasts 24h, after which roll 2d and pick one:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity.

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and any necessary rehab.
