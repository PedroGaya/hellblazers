# Initiative

If you want a more structured way to change the spotlight, use these variants of token initiative:

## Regular

Give each players **two tokens**, which they can spend at any time to _seize the spotlight_ and do a beat (usually an action roll). Once everyone spent their tokens, the situation changes and everyone gets their tokens back. The GM interjects at will.

## Scrambles

Each player adds **two tokens** to a bag, and the GM adds a _round end token_. Players take tokens out of the bag and act accordingly. If the round end token is pulled, the GM changes the situation and everyone puts their tokens back into the bag. The GM interjects at will, or adds their own tokens to the bag.
