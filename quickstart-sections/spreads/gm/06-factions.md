## Factions

Between sessions, track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:

- **Resources** that show their power and influence - like **assets** and **capital** - allocated to a **front**.
- **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track with challenges, each using at least a **goal pool** and a **fail pool**.
- **Agendas** that represent their ambitions and philosophy, as well as **representatives** that embody and push these agendas.

## Fronts

An abstraction of an ideological (or literal) battleground where the conflicts between factions take place. Keep 2-4 active factions in each, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals.

**Faction goals and resources always refer to a front** - They do not represent the faction in their totality, but only what they're willing to allocate to this given front.

## Faction Turn

Once after a session and during downtime, the GM resolves a **faction turn**. Each faction at play can spend capital to make a **faction move** in any front, once per faction pool, and all moves are resolved simultaneously. Once a faction pool clears, the fiction changes:

- d8 Seize an Asset - d4 Asset Hidden or Moved
- d4 Reveal Their Secrets - d4 Spy Caught
- etc.

Before moves are made, **each faction gains as much capital as it has assets**, plus one. Then, they may spend one capital to buy their first asset, two capital for the second, and so on. Once spent, **capital is removed from play**.

## Make A Play

The factions mobilizes its forces to push for progress in their goals - This can be a show of force, media slander, or anything else that might advance their **agenda**. To _make a play_, **roll one of their own goal pools** or **roll any fail pool**. Factions can't _Make A Play_ more than once on the same goal, per turn.

## Consolidate

A faction holds their position and defends a goal from subterfuge or enemy action - **Consolidated goals cannot have their fail pools rolled this turn**.

## Support

**Supports a _Make A Play_ or _Consolidate_ move** - Factions can not only advance their goals, but support other factions in theirs as well. Factions can't receive _Support_ on **secret** faction pools. Factions can't support themselves.

When resolving moves, check if there is a surplus of **support** onto _Consolidate_ or _Make A Play_. If _Make A Play_ wins, _Consolidate_ is "broken" and the fail pool is rolled. Otherwise, the pool remains as is.

## Against The Crew

**Factions moves can be made against the crew as if they were impact moves**. You can target their assets, contacts, cohorts or reputation - Through faction goals, or when otherwise prompted. Instead of making an impact move, you may also trigger a relevant entanglement.

**The crew is not a faction** - The PCs are _punks_ and in no way have access to the **capital** necessary to operate a faction. However, they can act alongside or against any faction, as well as play a hand in the faction game by targeting faction goals, fail states, assets, etc.
