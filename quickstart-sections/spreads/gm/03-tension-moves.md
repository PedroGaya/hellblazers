## Tension Moves

As players can twist reality to their favor by spending fate, the GM does so by means of this move, and like players, builds tension when doing so. Tension keeps the world active when things stall - When your supply of tension runs dry, you can use these to jumpstart the action again. However, use them carefully — **_overuse_** can get frustrating for players, so pick your spots. But **_timely_** use makes good sense.

## Lucky Break

**Resolve a problem the PCs face, use sudden exposition to connect some dots or skip an impact move.**

_Break_ a scene when players are stuck, backed into a corner, or a scene feels dull. It provides a quick out and moves the story forward. Normally, it would feel like an unearned freebie, the tension you gain makes it a fair trade. Never use it when players are engaged — save it for when it's needed.

## Devil's Bargain

**Propose an interesting bargain to a PC. Take tension only if they accept.**

_Bargain_ with a player by proposing a juicy bonus for their PC. Push **_dilemmas_** and **_drama_** towards their character details, or force their hand with consequences. In exchange, they may get bonus dice in a roll, advantages or just get what they want.

Remember you only gain tension if they accept, so it's up to you to make the offer irresistible. Don't push hard — this mechanic is built to respect player agency. Don't punish for saying no.

## Bad Omen

**Give fate to each PC, then give a brief vignette before upcoming action.**

_Give them a bad omen_ to focus in tight on your PCs, and to stage moments for major events. These vignettes that set the scene, whether a quiet campfire scene or tense moment before a battle, give players a chance to add depth and feeling to their characters that might get overlooked, and the "**_free_**" fate they gain lets them know that what's ahead is going to be a real challenge.
