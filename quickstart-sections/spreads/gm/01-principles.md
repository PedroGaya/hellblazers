# Moves

## Basic Principles

As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out here to referee an engaging and dynamic game.

Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a rule and just let the narrative take over.

Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension, and memorable moments.

## Moves

**_The specific rules that you, the GM, play by_**.

- **_Story moves_** set you up for narrative success and allow proper framing of the fiction. May prompt impact moves later.
- **_Tension moves_** help the players out in some way **or** escalate the situation. **_Generate tension when used._**
- **_Impact moves_** deal significant consequences, crank up the danger, and make the world feel powerful.

A **prompt** is a trigger for you to make an impact move, caused by things like grim or messy action rolls, a relevant depleted pool, unaddressed foreshadowing, or by spending tension. Other moves don't have to be prompted - make them at will, albeit judiciously.

## Tension

When PCs ride the synchronicity freeway, they don't do so at no cost - **_Twisting reality builds tension_**. While players require _fate_ for this, as GM, you are empowered to do so with **tension moves**. In any case, you **generate tension** when reality is manipulated in these ways, which you can then spend at any time to _prompt an impact move._

Tension is a diminishing pool of dice - When you want to leave things up to chance, _roll the tension pool_. How bad the situation is for the players is proportional to the amount of dropped dice.

## Consequences

What happens when things go wrong — from failed rolls, timers, or impact moves. They should feel **_hard but fair_**, reflecting the stakes and severity of the situation. Every roll carries risk; otherwise, assume success and move on.

Physical harm is a solid baseline: in a fight, you get damage. Other consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There’s no strict formula — _it’s a gut feeling_. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction its teeth. You can always:

- **Split it**: Breaking big consequences into smaller ones, making the story move in multiple directions.
- **Spread It**: Hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who didn't prompt the move, making the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.
- **Hit offscreen**: Builds suspense, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. Unseen events make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.
- **Use pools**: Start or roll a danger or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often **_offscreen_**.
- **Skip it**: If nothing comes to mind, prompt a _Lucky Break_ and generate tension instead.
- **Turn it up**: On a _disaster_, don't pack any punches and make the opportunity count. Whatever bad thing would happen, make it _worse_.
