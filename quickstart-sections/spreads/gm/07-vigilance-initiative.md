# Vigilance

The assumed alertness of the PCs, avoiding overly cautious gameplay to keep the focus on the action.

**_PCs are always considered to be as vigilant as their vantage allows_** when dealing with hidden dangers like _traps_, _lies_, or _secret doors_. However, this doesn't mean they are always aware of hidden threats. Instead, the GM uses a gut feeling to decide how much the PC perceives based on their vantage and the type of tension the GM wants to build.

Each of the three levels of vigilance creates a different dynamic in the scene, a different view of PC competence and the danger of the world. These three levels are: **hint**, **reveal**, and **strike**.

## Hint

To give a **hint**, _Foreshadow_ with a subtle clue about a hidden element. **_The player_** gets a single chance to interpret the situation. They're limited to just one to highlight the natural response of the PC and to keep things flowing. **_Player intuition guides the story forward._** A correct response leads to a reveal or possibly bypasses the situation entirely.

## Reveal

To **reveal**, _Foreshadow_ with an obvious unveiling of an immediately imminent threat. **_The PC_** that becomes aware has one chance to react before the danger strikes. **_Character competence guides the story forward._**

## Strike

To **strike**, make an impact move as the danger immediately strikes them. **_The GM_** assumes the PCs were not vigilant enough. **_The dangerous world guides the story forward._**

# Initiative

If you want a more structured way to change the spotlight, use these variants of token initiative:

## Regular

Give each player **two tokens**, which they can spend at any time to _seize the spotlight_ and do a beat (usually an action roll). Once everyone spent their tokens, the situation changes and everyone gets their tokens back. The GM interjects at will.

## Scrambles

Each player adds **two tokens** to a bag, and the GM adds a _round end token_. Players take tokens out of the bag and act accordingly. If the round end token is pulled, the GM makes an impact move and everyone puts their tokens back into the bag. The GM adds their own tokens to the bag.
