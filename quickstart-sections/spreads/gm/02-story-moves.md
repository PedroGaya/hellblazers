## Keep The Story Moving

While _tension moves_ and _impact moves_ allow you to play at (and as) the world, remember that you are building a narrative as a group - and a cinematic one at that. Player actions drive the story, and **story moves** nudge them forward. That doesn't mean the world is passive — you can describe anything happening that makes sense.

From a story and gameplay perspective, it's more satisfying when the players have **_fair warning_** about trouble. They know actions have consequences and built-up tension will come back to bite them. This feels fair, so outside of these you give them the initiative.

## Foreshadow

**Hint at trouble, sometimes with a timer pool. Prompts a later impact move.**

_Foreshadow_ to signal upcoming threats and give the players a chance to react. This is a great way to introduce adversity when you don't have or want to spend tension. If they fail to deal with it or ignore the danger, it prompts an impact move and the pace of the story picks up.

## Question

**Ask provocative questions to stir up drama or flesh out the world.**

_Question_ players to help suss out what kind of story they're interested in, share the creative load, and keep the story fresh for yourself. Try to keep this focused on their character's perspective, but feel free to dip into the meta channel here and talk directly as players about what you all want to see play out in game.

## Set The Scene

**Use a montage roll to determine how a scene starts off when it’s unclear.**

_Set The Scene_ when you're unsure about the specifics of the current fiction or want to dive straight into the action. Skip detailed planning and cautious leadups that often drag gameplay down. Instead, jump straight into the action, an _in medias res_ shot of things already in motion. The roll sets the opening mood and stakes for the scene. On a grim, it can even trigger an impact move, kicking things off with a bang and raising the suspense right away.

## Spotlight

**Focus attention on a PC, encouraging them to act or follow-up.**

_Spotlight_ PCs to help direct the action, ensure no one is left out, and put focus where it's needed. This prompts players towards action. Mix in cinematic language like "We cut to..." or "The camera pans over to show..." as you use the "camera", your group's shared imagination space. Cut back and forth between PCs and scenes to build tension and avoid focusing on a single PC for too long.

## Wrap It Up

**Call for a montage roll or jump to a likely conclusion to a scene.**

_Wrap It Up_ when a scene has served its purpose, grown stale, or feels like a foregone conclusion. Don't waste game time on these. Closing these scenes out decisively keeps the narrative tight and focuses on what's next.
