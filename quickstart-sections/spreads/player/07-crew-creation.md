## Crew Creation

Choose an archetype from:

- Occult Investigators
- Shady Cult
- Cyber-Terrorists
- Illegal Gas-Biker Gang
- Scrappy Losers Stuck Together

Each provides a procedure for setting it up. In general:

- **Traits**: Your shared traits as a crew expand your vantage when _working together_. Choose two that match and one that doesn't.
- **Purpose**: Why are you a crew? What are your goals? What do you believe in? Answers are shared by the group. Write at least one.
- **Hideout**: Pick a place for your base of operations. Be wary of factions already there.
- **Upgrades**: Your **assets**, **contacts** or **cohorts** - Anything that bolster your capabilities as a crew. Choose two.
- **Reputation**: Determine your starting reputations based on assets and hideout.
- **Resources**: Acquisitional power shared by the crew.

## Assets

Your assets represent **equipment**, **territory claims** or **improvements** to the hideout.

Examples:

| Goods             | Claims     | Improvements       |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| Motorbikes        | Warehouse  | Vault              |
| Heist Equipment   | Laboratory | Hidden Entrance    |
| Heavy Armory      | Turf       | Underground Access |
| High-end Servers  | Shops      | Security System    |
| Supplies          | Dive Bar   | Medical Bay        |
| Drugs and Alcohol | Building   | Cover Operation    |

## Contacts and Cohorts

These are the people willing to help the crew. **Contacts** are specific people, usually specialists of some kind. **Cohorts** are your generic helpers or goons, they act as a group on tasks they're capable of.

Examples:

| Contacts      | Cohorts      |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| Nurse         | Local Kids   |
| Cyberdoc      | Punks        |
| Drug Dealer   | Hired Muscle |
| Courtesan     | Regulars     |
| Detective     | Scum         |
| Quartermaster | Corrupt Cops |

## Reputation

The relationships of your crew with the factions and communities around them. Like with bonds, match standing with nature. You're free to write your own natures, but standings always range from "Allies" to "At War".

| Standing | Nature  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Allies   | Debt    |
| Positive | Revenge |
| Neutral  | Respect |
| Mixed    | Fear    |
| Enemies  | Hate    |
| At War   | Rivalry |

You start at _mixed/x_ with the **cops**, and have _some_ relationship to the **locals** around your lair.

## Entanglements Table

A shared repository of possible events that may happen to the crew during downtime. During crew creation, each player may add an entry, after which point the GM takes over the table's management.
