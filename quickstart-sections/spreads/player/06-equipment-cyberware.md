## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

## Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's investments or other signifiers of income. To increase it, purchase **assets** such as expensive equipment or a home. Each asset increases your lifestyle by 1, and costs **(new lifestyle rating) \* 10 resources**. They're of a quality or prestige proportional to your new lifestyle.

| Lifestyle | Affordable Stuff                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | A shot of shitty liquor. Food for a day.    |
| 1         | Rent in a shanty town. Minor amenities.     |
| 2         | Old tech. Home repairs.                     |
| 3         | Short trips. Black market firearms.         |
| 4+        | Rent in the good side of town. Investments. |

| Lifestyle | Assets                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0         | You own nothing.                        |
| 1         | Cheap lease. Bad computers.             |
| 2         | Your own flat. Appliances.              |
| 3         | Expensive security system. Vehicles.    |
| 4         | A small business. High-grade cyberware. |

## Equipment

You're assumed to own the tools and have the skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**. Store anything else you acquire in your personal **stash** or **crew storage**.

You also have **three equipment slots** used for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might change your capabilities from the standard of your profession. Particularly heavy items occupy two slots instead of one. If you fill a fourth or fifth slot, you become **encumbered** and cannot run, climb, carry more items etc. You can't fill more than five slots.

Items that do not affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just note them in your character sheet, or take it as a _given_.

## Loadout

Characters **preparing for action** can instead use a **loadout** - So long as your character has a loadout, they can **spend fate** to fill equipment slots with items from their stash at any time.

If you choose a **_light_** loadout, you get **two slots**, but **cannot carry heavy items**. If you choose a **_heavy_** loadout, you get **four slots**, but must declare heavy items beforehand. If you fill a third slot while light, you become heavy. Like with standard equipment, if you fill a fifth slot, you become encumbered, and can't fill more than five.

Using a loadout changes your vantage - _light_ characters are usually inconspicuous and agile, while _heavy_ characters are strapped up and ready to go. _Encumbered_ characters are sluggish and prone to errors.

## Cyberware

Each character has **five slots** for installing cyberware. Like with equipment, each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots proportional to its impact on the body - one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**.

## Neurodrugs

Neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity** and allow for cyberware installation. If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to abstinence), the user starts **crashing out**.

## Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

**The first stage usually lasts 24h**, after which **roll 2d and pick one**:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity (+1).

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and any necessary rehab.
