## Fate

_**Fate** represents your character's capacity to ride the synchronicity freeway._ It's a d6, you can have up to three at a time, and can **spend** them to:

- _**Get +1d on a roll**_ - To account for supernatural effort, _protagonist power_;
- _**Introduce a fact** to the fiction as a **story twist**_ - Something that just happened to be true and that affects the scene;

## Tension

A shared **diminishing pool** of dice representing accumulated unluck. **Add 1d to the tension pool whenever fate is spent**. **The GM can spend a tension die to prompt an impact move at any time**.

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**? **Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Your vantage can expand or diminish along a scale in steps called **_advantages_** and **_disadvantages_**, respectively.

- **Your vantage is...** - Guaranteed - Given - Stretch - Reach - Impossible
- **It roughly means...** - Always - Should - Could - Absurd - Never

The shifts are **momentary**, an out-of-the-ordinary situation that changes what your character is and is not able to do.

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. **Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage is set dressing**; Like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense.

Similarly, **any details that do not significantly shift vantage are set dressing**. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing.

## Story Twists

If you want introduce story details to the fiction that go beyond set dressing, you want to introduce a **_twist_**:

## Complications

Character-driven **disadvantages** you add to a scene and have to follow-up on. They must stem from your character details and always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unforeseen consequences_** of _your_ actions.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Trouble_** from _your_ beliefs or backstory.

**Whenever you introduce a complication, take a tension die as fate**.

## Coincidences

Character-driven **advantages** you add to a scene. Like with complications, these must be tied to your character. These are things like:

- **_Character details_** that add to a scene, like gear or contacts;
- **_Scene details_** that affect _your_ vantage, like NPC actions or features;
- **_Setting details_**: History, geography, factions...

**To introduce a coincidence, spend fate**.
