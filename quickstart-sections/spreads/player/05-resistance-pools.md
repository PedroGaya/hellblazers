## Resistance Pools

Whenever a character takes **damage** or **stress**, drop a die from body/mind, or roll if severe. _Damage_ affects the _body_, _stress_ affects the _mind_. If you only have one die left in the pool, always drop it instead of rolling.

| The "Accident"                          | The Severity       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| _Fall from great height. Getting shot._ | Roll body.         |
| _A sucker punch. Tear gas._             | Drop 1d from body. |
| _Witnessing gore. A really bad trip._   | Roll mind.         |
| _Rejection. Relentless mockery._        | Drop 1d from mind. |

Whenever you **recover**, add dice back to the pool equal to the amount recovered.

## Fallout

As the result of an impact move, or whenever you deplete a pool, you may take **fallout**. The GM tells you _how much_ (at least one, up to three), but you choose whatever makes the most sense from:

- Getting **vexed**;
- Taking a **condition**;
- Getting a **scar**;

Taking two or more fallout leaves you **dropped** - out of the scene.

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**. Interpret the response, which always takes a beat or two, then clear the vex. If you get dropped and take vex, then your choice of vex explains why your character is out of the scene.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. Can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible. Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

## Scars

Change any character detail and **mark it** as a scar, then take fate. You can:

- Strain a **bond**;
- Embody or reject a **trait**;
- Change a **belief**;
- Gain a **feature**;
- Anything else that makes sense.

If appropriate, you may also break or destroy **equipment** and **cyberware**.

## Long-Term Afflictions

**_Players have final say on any long-term conditions and scars._** In these cases, work with the GM to find a good fit your your PC and the situation. This includes **character death**.

## Death

Death does not come unwarranted - it must be clearly understood as a possibility from the get go. Whenever you're about to take damage, the GM may indicate it as **lethal**: You always take three fallout and, if you are dropped, the GM makes a tension roll under a cup - Once someone checks your body, **if _any_ dice are dropped**, your character is dead.
