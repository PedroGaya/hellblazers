## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**. Interpret the response, which always takes a beat or two, then clear the vex.

## Marks

A mark is slight harm - a bruise, sprain, headache, dizzyness, etc. Often taken as consequences from _messy rolls_. When suffered, mark the stat most relevant to the harm - You get _+1t_ on your next roll with that stat, then clear the mark.

If you would mark an already marked stat, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take regular damage instead.

## Damage

Whenever a character takes **damage**, drop a die from either resistance pool, or roll if **severe**. If you only have one die left in the pool, always drop it instead of rolling.

| The "Accident"                          | The Severity       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| _Fall from great height. Getting shot._ | Roll body.         |
| _A sucker punch. Tear gas._             | Drop 1d from body. |
| _Witnessing gore. A really bad trip._   | Roll mind.         |
| _Rejection. Relentless mockery._        | Drop 1d from mind. |

## Fallout

As the result of an impact move, or whenever you deplete a resistance pool, you may take **fallout**. The GM tells you _how much_ fallout to (at least one, up to three), but you choose whatever makes the most sense from:

- Destroyed **equipment** or **cyberware**;
- Taking a **condition**;
- Getting **trauma**;

Taking two or more fallout leaves you **dropped** - out of the scene. You can take the same fallout more than once.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. Can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible. Conditions clear when it makes sense, like after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

## Scars

Change any character detail and **mark it** as trauma. You can:

- Strain a **bond**;
- Embody or reject a **trait**;
- Change a **belief**;
- Gain a **feature**;
- Anything else that makes sense.

Describe your characterâ€™s trauma reaction in the current circumstance. You decide how intense this reaction is, and if it causes a problem for your character. To heal from trauma, work with the GM to find an appropriate method; Each character's trauma is personal, and the path to recovery should be, too.

## Long-Term Afflictions

**_Players have final say on any long-term conditions and trauma._** In these cases, work with the GM to find a good fit your your PC and the situation. This includes **character death**.

## Death

Death does not come unwarranted - it must be clearly understood as a possibility from the get go. Whenever you're about to take damage, the GM may indicate it as **lethal**: You always take three fallout and, if you are dropped, the GM makes a story roll under a cup - your character is dead on a grim.
