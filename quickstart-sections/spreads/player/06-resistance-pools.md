## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**. Interpret the response, which always takes a beat or two, then clear the vex.

## Marks

A mark is slight harm - a bruise, sprain, headache, dizzyness, etc. Often taken as consequences from _messy rolls_. When suffered, mark the stat most relevant to the harm - You get _+1t_ on your next roll with that stat, then clear the mark.

If you would mark an already marked stat, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take regular damage instead. Marks clear after rolls or after enough time has passed (up to GM).

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible. Unlike marks, conditions only clear when it makes sense, like after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

## Damage

Whenever a character takes **damage**, drop a die from either resistance pool, or roll if **severe**. If you only have one die left in the pool, always drop it instead of rolling.

| The "Accident"                          | The Severity       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| _Fall from great height. Getting shot._ | Roll body.         |
| _A sucker punch. Tear gas._             | Drop 1d from body. |
| _Witnessing gore. A really bad trip._   | Roll mind.         |
| _Rejection. Relentless mockery._        | Drop 1d from mind. |

## Fallout

Whenever you deplete a resistance pool, you take **fallout** and it leaves you **dropped** - out of the scene. When you take fallout, some details on your character sheet _will_ change. Choose whatever makes the most sense from:

- Straining a **bond**;
- Embodying or rejecting a **trait**;
- Changing a **belief**;
- Gaining a **feature**;
- Anything else that makes sense.

In any case, highlight the change on your character sheet and describe your character’s reaction in the current circumstance - You decide how intense this reaction is, and if it causes a problem.

If it was **traumatic**, portray it as such and work with the GM to find an appropriate healing method, if any; Each character's trauma is personal, and the path to recovery should be, too.

## Death

Death does not come unwarranted - it must be clearly understood as a possibility from the get go. Whenever you're about to take damage, the GM may indicate it as **lethal**: If you are dropped from it, the GM makes a story roll under a cup - your character is dead on a bad roll.
