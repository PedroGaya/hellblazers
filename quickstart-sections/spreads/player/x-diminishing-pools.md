## Diminishing Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When **triggered**, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool **clears** and the fiction changes.

- **Timer Pool**: Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.
- **Danger Pool**: Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.
- **Task Pool**: Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.
- **Resource Pool**: Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.
- **Power Pool**: The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect** - You can also always drop the last die in a task pool when triggered.
