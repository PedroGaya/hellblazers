## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

## Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's investments or other signifiers of income. To increase it, purchase **assets** such as expensive equipment or a home. Each asset increases your lifestyle by 1 and costs **(new lifestyle rating) \* 10 resources**. They're of a quality or prestige proportional to your new lifestyle.

| Lifestyle | Affordable Stuff                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | A shot of shitty liquor. Food for a day.    |
| 1         | Rent in a shanty town. Minor amenities.     |
| 2         | Old tech. Home repairs.                     |
| 3         | Short trips. Black market firearms.         |
| 4+        | Rent in the good side of town. Investments. |

| Lifestyle | Assets                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0         | You own nothing.                        |
| 1         | Cheap lease. Bad computers.             |
| 2         | Your own flat. Appliances.              |
| 3         | Expensive security system. Vehicles.    |
| 4         | A small business. High-grade cyberware. |

## Equipment

You're assumed to own the tools and have the skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**. Store anything else you acquire in your personal **stash** or **crew storage**.

You also have **five equipment slots** used for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might change your capabilities from the standard of your profession. Particularly heavy items occupy two slots instead of one. If you fill your **fourth or fifth** slot, you become **encumbered** and cannot run, climb, carry more items etc. You can't fill more than five slots.

Items that do not affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just note them in your character sheet, or take it as a _given_.

## Loadout

Characters **preparing for action** can instead use a **loadout** - **So long as your character has a loadout**, they can **spend fate** to fill equipment slots with items from their stash at any time.

If you choose a **_light_** loadout, you get **two slots**, but **cannot carry heavy items**. If you choose a **_heavy_** loadout, you get **four slots**, but must declare heavy items beforehand. If you fill a third or fourth slot while light, you become heavy. While heavy, if you fill a fifth slot, you become encumbered, and can't fill more than five without becoming encumbered.

Using a loadout changes your vantage - _light_ characters are usually inconspicuous and agile, while _heavy_ characters are strapped up and ready to go. _Encumbered_ characters are sluggish and prone to errors.
