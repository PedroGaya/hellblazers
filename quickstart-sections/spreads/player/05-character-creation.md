## Character Creation In Summary

1. Roll for your early days - 1d6 for starting resources, 1d6 for upbringing
2. Acquire an NDI with your starting resources (you can get in debt), or become a **_non-citizen_**.
3. Roll for starting age.
4. Roll 1d6 twice for life paths and choose one.
5. Roll 1d6 twice for opportunities within your path and choose one.
6. Decide on a turning point, roll for aging, then return to (4) if you want to.
7. Give yourself a name, traits and features.

## Early Days

Start character creation by rolling 1d6 for resources and 1d6 for upbringing:

- **1-3** for **2 resources**, poor
- **4/5** for **3 resources**, less poor
- **6** for **4 resources**, middle class

- **1-3** for **Upper City Life** - 1 fate, 1 endurance
- **4/5** for **Lower City Life** - 2 fate, 1 endurance, -1 resources, 1 cash
- **6** for **Offworld** - 1 fate, 1 endurance, -1 resources, 2 cash

After rolling, if you were raised in the upper city, you must acquire a neurodigital interface - Make the acquisition with your starting resources, use cash if you must. If you were raised in the lower city or offworld, you can forgo the acquisition and live as a **_non-citizen_**:

- All other acquisitions during character creation cost +1 resources.
- You can't take government opportunities, although shady corporations may be willing to hire you.

You can pay twice as much for a **_ghosted_** NDI - By exploiting a known, unfixable, vulnerability in certain algorithms, all government systems and most corporate systems will flag you as a citizen without you or your cyberware being actually registered (ignore all consequences of being a non-citizen).

| Neurodigital Interface | Description                            | Price       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Standard               | Can be found in dumpsters, 2 slots     | 2 resources |
| High-End               | Imported from Earth, 1 slots           | 4 resources |
| Elite                  | Used by athletes or millitary, 0 slots | 6 resources |

If you are a non-citizen or newborn, then at any point during character creation, you can take -1 max resources to acquire a City-Provided NDI: You agree to sell your NDI data in perpetuity and exclusivity to the city and get to be a citizen for it. You otherwise can't get in debt during this step of character creation, as your support network is footing the bills.

Now, roll 12 + d6 for your starting age, then roll 1d6 twice and choose one for life path.

## Life Paths

- **Opportunities**: A d6 table with careers, trades and other such things. Each modifies your stats, endurance and resources by a set amount.
- **Wises**: Each life path provides a wide range of wises - Choose two from the list, or write your own.
- **Equipment and Cyberware**: Some opportunities may require you to buy stuff - If that's your only option, get into debt. Otherwise, pick the other one.
- **Age**: Roll 1d6 three times, choose two to add to your age.
- **Turning Point**: A d6 table with common ways to leave the path. Roll 1d6 twice and pick one, or write your own.

Notice that your upbringing gave you a starting amount of fate points - You may spend them now during character creation to skip rolling on a table and choose an entry instead.

## Finishing Up

- **Traits**: Choose three that match your character and two that don't at all.
- **Features**: Detail three distinctive outward features of your character.
- **Bonds**: Write or roll one per path (with either NPCs or factions).
- **Beliefs**: Write at least one and up to three.
- **Resources**: Subtract your strain from your resources - This is your new max. Zero your strain.
- **Joining The Crew**: Use your last turning point as a reason, or write your own. Write bonds with PCs as you see fit.
