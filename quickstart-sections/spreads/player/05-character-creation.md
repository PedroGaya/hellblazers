## Character Creation

Characters start with two life paths - Each includes six professions, granting unique stats and wises. Turning points tell you how you left the first path for the second, then finally how you left the second and found your crew.

### Upbringing

- **Age**: Start at 16 y/o.
- **Stats**: Start with 1 in each.
- **Social Class**: Roll 2d, pick one and increase its indicated stats.
- **Birthplace**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources and Lifestyle**: Set them as indicated by your social class.

### Life Paths

- **Path**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Profession**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources**: Add the listed amount to your character sheet.
- **Lifestyle**: Modify it by the indicated amount.
- **Stats**: Increase indicated stats by one.
- **Wises**: Note down your three wises, or create your own.
- **Equipment and Cyberware**: Spend your resources to buy what you want _and_ what is **required** of you.
- **Age**: Roll 3d, choose 2 to add to age.
- **Turning Point**: Roll 2d, pick one.

Repeat for the second life path.

### Debts

During character creation, you may be required by certain professions to have certain pieces of cyberware or expensive equipment. Of course, **you have to pay for these**. If you can't, choose a different profession or work with your GM to create a debt-holder NPC, then add one or more **debt bonds** to your character sheet to acquire what you need.

## Finishing Up

- **Talents**: Choose one whose pre-requisites you meet.
- **Age**: Roll 2d and choose one or both to add to your age, representing your time before finding a crew.
- **Traits**: Choose three that match your character and two that don't at all.
- **Features**: Detail three distinctive outward features of your character.
- **Bonds**: Write or roll one for each PC.
- **Beliefs**: Write at least one and up to three.
- **Resistances**: Each is a diminishing pool of size equal to the sum of its paired stats.

## Archetypes

Instead of building a character from the ground up, you can use an **archetype**. Each has specific rules on how to create your character, and they all output a character of a certain kind. If you just want to quickly build _a type of guy_, choose the appropriate archetype.
