## Cyberware

Each character has **five slots** for installing cyberware. Like with equipment, each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots proportional to its impact on the body - one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**.

## Neurodrugs

Neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity** and allow for cyberware installation. If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to abstinence), the user starts **crashing out**.

## Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

**The first stage usually lasts 24h**, after which **roll 2d and pick one**:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity (+1).

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and any necessary rehab.
