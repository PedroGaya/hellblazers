## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the outcome - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim result is cut by a **_thorn_**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster. Thorns go from 0t (tough task) to 3t (impossible task).

## Smooth Flow

If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can **keep things moving** - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.

## Working Together

- **Assist**: You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**.
- **Teamwork**: When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.
- **Follow-up**: When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.
- **Outside Assistance**: When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

## Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, clarifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences.

## Defense Roll

Roll to lessen or avoid incoming trouble by suffering some other, lesser consequence. The player calls for the roll.

The GM states by how much the trouble will be decreased, then picks a stat to test and sets the costs.

- **Perfect**: The consequence is lightened - _it is delayed_, _you take a mark_,.
- **Messy**: The standard consequences - _take damage_, _a short-term condition_.
- **Grim**: Severe consequences - _worsen reputation_, _get vexed_.

## Story Roll

The GM rolls up to 3d to outsource decisions. Roll 1d for bad odds, 2d for even odds and 3d for good odds.

- **Perfect**: It's the ideal situation.
- **Messy**: It's okay, but there's a catch.
- **Grim**: It's not good, and now it's a problem.

## Montage Roll

Roll 2d to abstract a scene into a montage. If other PCs want to join in, each rolls 2d and shares the risk, the best result counts for the whole group. You can't roll criticals during montages. Interpret results as you would a story roll.
