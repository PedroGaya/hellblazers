## Downtime

Narrative stretches between significant action or free-play are filled with **downtime**. While players work on **downtime activities**, the GM deals with the entanglements table and factions. When everyone is done, or if otherwise prompted, play resumes.

Players have two free activities available to them during downtime. Activities and downtime don't take a fixed amount of time - They are always **paced for drama**, **not realism**.

## Entanglements

**If, at the start of downtime, the tension pool has 4 or more dice, it is rolled**. Each dropped dice **prompts an impact move from the entanglements table**. Entanglements describes _a thing that happens to the crew_ â€“ some thugs annoy you, the cops come to interrogate you or mistakes come running back.

The GM may bring any one these moves into play immediately, hold them off until appropriate or make them as bonus **faction moves** (so long as they're made against the players).

Once prompted by the table, these moves cannot be skipped. The GM decides whether or not to cross them out from the table once resolved - some events only make sense as a one-time occurence, while cops being annoying is an all-the-time worry.

## Editing The Table

Every type of crew has a table that starts with a predetermined set of events. There are three ways of editing it:

- **Skipping Impact Moves**: Whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you may add it to an empty slot in the table, or if full, replace an old entry.
- **Spend Tension**: Immediately add an impact move to the table. Do this at any time during free play, making sure to tie it to the fiction.
- **Delaying Consequences**: Instead of following through, you may lighten a consequence by adding it to the table.

Don't attempt to add an entire scene as an entry - keep it punchy. List the move's name and a simple evocative description. Entaglements are not the whole story, they're narrative seeds, sowed at the table, reaped only when rolled or otherwise prompted again.

## Activities

- **Heal**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise heal. Recover body equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Unwind**: Indulge, or otherwise relax. Recover mind equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Commune**: Shared time with the crew. Reckon with **fate**, then fully recover mind. All must pick at the same time.
- **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool according to the size of the work, as well as determining what happens when cleared. Roll it when working.
- **Acquire**: Peruse and purchase _assets_ or _equipment_ not covered by your lifestyle rating.
- **Circles**: Roll story to create or find useful NPCs, such as a _contact_ or _cohorts_. Results determine how the scene goes.

## Reckoning With Fate

During _Commune_, **fate** is awarded to characters based on criteria described below.

For each character, work through these questions alone or as a group - If you answer "yes", or if it feels otherwise appropriate, **earn fate**.

- **The Troublesome Questions**: Did your features, traits or other character details get you in trouble or create awkward situations?
- **The Conviction Questions**: Did you manifest your beliefs? Did you follow them with purpose? Did you achieve a goal?
- **The Vantage Questions**: Did you have the right skills at the right time? Did you keep the story moving?

The awards below are given by **votes** - everyone can vote for any character, most voted gets the award and **earns fate**. Unlike the questions, where everyone can earn fate, each award is only given out once.

- **The Embodiement Award**: Did you capture the mood at the table? Did you go above and beyond with roleplaying?
- **The Moldbreaker Award**: Did your character struggle with inner turmoil? Were they tormented by conflict?
- **The Defiance Award**: Did you defy fate at every turn? Did you go against the dice, at great cost?

Any fate earned beyond the max of three is taken as bonus XP.
