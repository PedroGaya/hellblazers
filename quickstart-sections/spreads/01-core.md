## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the outcome - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim result is cut by a **_thorn_**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster. Thorns go from 0t (tough task) to 3t (impossible task).

## Working Together

- **Assist**: You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**.
- **Teamwork**: When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.
- **Follow-up**: When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.
- **Outside Assistance**: When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

## Dice Rolls

### Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, clarifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a **defense roll** against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls.

### Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

### Montage Roll

Roll 2d to abstract a scene into a montage. The results determine how well it goes. If other PCs want to join in, each rolls 2d and shares the risk. You can't roll criticals during montages.

### Tension Roll

The GM rolls the tension pool to outsource decisions to luck. Results unfavorable to players - "Perfect" is the worst outcome.

## Diminishing Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When **triggered**, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

- **Timer Pool**: Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.
- **Danger Pool**: Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.
- **Task Pool**: Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.
- **Resource Pool**: Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.
- **Power Pool**: The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect** - You can also always drop the last die in a task pool when triggered.
