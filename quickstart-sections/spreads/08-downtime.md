## Downtime

While players work on **downtime activities** spread over **cycles**, the GM deals with the entanglements table and factions. When everyone is done with their downtime activities, or if otherwise prompted, free play begins once again.

A downtime cycle refers to the minimum amount of leisure time available for PCs to engage with activities. Activities take an amount of time measured in cycles, **not actual time**. The length of time available in a cycle should be settled on by the group. By default, a handful of days, so that there are two cycles in a week. In play, the standard downtime phase amounts to **two cycles**.

During times of **crisis**, the amount of available cycles is halved. Crisis can be entered as an extreme consequence or when at war with a faction.

## Entanglements

The GM makes a _tension roll_ where each dropped dice **prompts an impact move from the entanglements table**. Entanglements describes a thing that happens to the crew â€“ some thugs annoy you, the cops come to interrogate you or other mistakes come running back.

The GM may bring any one these moves into play immediately, hold them off until appropriate or make them as **faction moves** (so long as they're made against the players).

Once prompted by the table, these moves cannot be skipped. The GM decides whether or not to cross them out from the table once resolved - some events only make sense as a one-time occurence, while cops being annoying is an all-the-time worry.

### Editing The Table

Every table starts with a predetermined set of events by the crew type, and there are two ways of editing it:

- **Skipping Impact Moves**: Whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you may add it to an empty slot in the table, or if full, replace an old entry.
- **Spend Tension**: Immediately add an impact move to the table. Do this at any time during free play, or during downtime but before any rolls are made.

Don't attempt to add an entire scene as an entry - keep it punchy. List the move's name and a simple evocative description. Entaglements are not the whole story, they're narrative seeds sowed at the table, reaped only when rolled or otherwise prompted again.

## Activities

As soon as downtime starts, clear all marks and burned fate slots, roll all healing pools and reset per-session talents. Then, each player goes about as many activities as available to them.

- **Heal**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise heal. Recover body equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Unwind**: Indulge, or otherwise relax. Recover mind equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Acquire**: Peruse and purchase _assets_ or _equipment_ not covered by your lifestyle rating.
- **Commune**: Shared time with the crew. Tally and spend xp, then recover all mind dice. All must pick at the same time.
- **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool according to the size of the work, as well as determining what happens when cleared. Roll it when working.
- **Socialize**: Roll tension to create or find an useful NPC. Results determine how the scene goes.
