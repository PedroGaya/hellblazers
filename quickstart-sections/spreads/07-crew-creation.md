## Crew Creation

Choose an archetype from:

- Occult Investigators
- Shady Cult
- Cyber-Terrorists
- Illegal Gas-Biker Gang
- Scrappy Losers Stuck Together

Each provides a procedure for setting it up. In general:

- **Traits**: Your shared traits as a crew expand your vantage when _working together_. Choose two that match and one that doesn't.
- **Goals**: Shared by the group, often represented with a pool. Choose or write two, assign pools if needed.
- **Assets**: Material goods or useful people that bolster your capabilities. Choose two.
- **Lair**: Pick a place for your hideout. Be wary of factions already there.
- **Reputation**: Determine your starting reputations based on improvements and lair.

## Reputation

Like with bonds, match standing with nature. Interpret as makes sense.

| Standing | Nature  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Allies   | Debt    |
| Positive | Revenge |
| Neutral  | Respect |
| Mixed    | Fear    |
| Enemies  | Hate    |
| War      | Rivalry |

Choose between an _x/debt_ or _enemies/x_ reputation with the faction that previously occupied your lair's territory. You are always at least _mixed/x_ with the **cops**.

## Entanglements Table

A shared repository of possible events that may happen to the crew during downtime. During crew creation, each player may add an entry, after which point the GM takes over the table's management.
