## The Magic

The magic in Hellblazer comics operates under simple rules.

First and foremost, it's **real**. Undebiably so. However, to grasp this truth, one most willingly open their mind to it. In other words, magic is real in so far as you accept it as real. Otherwise, you'll spend your life in blissful ignorance.

Magic is also **human**. It comes only from people and their will, whatever that may be. To love, to live, to see another, to control, to kill, to maim - Whatever it is, reality conspires for it to become true. There's no pattern, logic or system - There are only paradoxes of human emotion, however dark they are, made manifest through whatever metaphysical powers that be.

Much like our emotions, magic is **liminal**. As a product of your sub-conscious, it is as ungraspable as we are. Like mist, it is at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time, going along with the whims of humanity. To accept magic as real is to accept a reality where the boundaries of what _is_ and what _isn't_ aren't well defined. During times like these, it's to accept a world where our deepest shadows can strike at any time.

## The Magician

There's no "magic system" - only people, our prayers and our rituals. These are our only interfaces through which magic can be accessed, requiring knowledge of the occult and faith.

Because people are unpredictable, so are the outcomes of magic, as well as the rigidity of the methods. There are as many ways to get rid of a ghost as there are ways to get rid of a person.

A spell is nothing but a repeatable formula to get rid of said ghost. However, even the most powerful spells are subject to the whims of magic - There are no guarantees. Only the depth of knowledge and faith of the magician may provide any solace in these trying tomes.

Because of this, mages are **charlatans** relying on confidence and tricks.

## The Weird

**Demons** think it's funny if they fuck with you under contract. Summoned from hell for benefits.
