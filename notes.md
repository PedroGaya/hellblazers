## Changelog

New content is **bolded**.

- Spark

  - Renamed to _fate_.

- **Fate**

  - You can now spend it for bonus dice, add story details or cheat death;
  - Three fate per character;
  - Fate slots can be _burned_ - You lose any fate in that slot, and can't gain anymore.
    - Burned slots can be recovered during downtime.

- Suspense

  - Renamed to _tension_;

- **Tension**

  - It's diminishing pool used in _tension rolls_;
  - It's diegetic "karma";
  - Spent by GM and players;

- Moves

  - Story moves are no longer "core moves";
  - Suspense moves became _tension moves_ and are thus diegetic;
    - Renamed _Buildup_ to _Bad Omen_, _Bridge_ to _Lucky Break_ and _Entangle_ to _Bargain_.
    - Removed _Cutaway_ and _Recap_;

- Vantage

  - Coupled with Creative Freedom
  - Introduced _advantage_ and _disadvantage_ - shifts in vantage triggered by mechanics.

- Story Points

  - Removed from the game, coupled into _story twists_ as _coincidences_.

- Tangles

  - Removed from the game, coupled into _story twists_ as _complications_.

- **Story Twists**

  - Twists can be complications or coincidences.
    - Complications work like old tangles. Get a _disadvantage_ for a fate point and drop tension.
    - Coincidences work like old story points. Change the scene and build tension in exchange for fate.

- Character Details

  - Removed _story arcs_.
  - Introduced **beliefs**.
    - Written statements about ambition. Just like the other game!
  - Expanded bonds to include NPC relationships.
  - **Resources** and **Lifestyle**
    - Abstractions of purchasing power and, well, lifestyle.
  - **Stash** for resources and equipment.
  - Removed _desires_
    - +1 Trait and +1 Anti-Trait as compensation.
    - Twice as many available traits, half "good" and half "bad"

- **Life Paths**

  - As seen in Venture!
  - Characters get an _upbringing_ and two _life paths_.
    - Each path grants a profession, three wises and a turning point.
    - You can go into debt (gain a bond) for equipment and cyberware.
    - You get resources and a lifestyle rating.
  - **_Must be rolled_**.

- **Archetypes**

  - Standard "classes" for characters.
  - Each provides alternative rules for creating characters of its type.
  - Paired with an "iconic character", like Johnny Silverhand.

- Damage

  - Harm now only applies to rolls under its governed stats.
  - Thorns from marks now stack with harm.
  - Vex no longer applies thorns.
  - Characters can get **scarred**.
    - Update your traits when traumatized or similar.

- **Equipment**

  - 4 slots for any equipment, regardless of size/weight.
  - Only track equipment that changes vantage (either up or down).

- **Cyberware**

  - 4 slots for cyberware.
  - Can be mechanical or neuralinked and have different tolls on body.
  - Heavy users can crash out, must use drugs to prevent it.

- Challenges

  - No longer give 2 bonus "suspense" (now tension) for use.
    - This is due to the larger tension pool.

- **Crew**

  - A shared character sheet representing the crew.
  - Has a **type** and **xp triggers**.
  - **Material improvements** for downtime and other activities.
  - **Heat** and a **fame level**, for tracking fame and infamy.
  - A secret **d20 entanglements table** used in downtime.
    - GM can spend tension at any time to prompt any impact move on the table.
    - The table can be edited by skipping impact moves, as all skips add the skipped move to the table.
  - **Special abilities** that work like talents.

- **Downtime**

  - The GM deals with **fallout**.
    - Updates heat and fame, then rolls for entanglements.
    - One roll per fame level, and each roll prompts an impact move.
      - Moves can also be faction moves, so long as they're made against the players.
      - These moves can be skipped for tension.
  - The players **heal** then do **downtime activities**:
    - **Recover**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise unwind.
    - **Acquisition**: Peruse and purchase _improvements_ or _equipment_.
    - **Commune**: Shared time with the crew.
    - **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool as work or a project, which is then rolled.
    - **Circles**: The GM rolls an NPC according to the player's needs and vantage.
  - How many activities depends on their reputation (usually, two activities per downtime).

- **Faction Turn**

  - **Factions** get to make moves against each other or the players between sessions.
  - They get:
    - **Resources** that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and capital.
    - **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a **faction pool**, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events (impact moves) in the story.
    - **Agendas** that represent their ambitions and philosophy, as well as **representatives** that embody and push these agendas.
    - **Tiers** that abstract the scale of their power and influence.
  - Factions get as many moves as their tier, per turn.
  - Moves include advancing goals, delaying other faction's pools and acquiring assets/resources.

- Push Yourself

  - Allows players to _burn a fate slot_ instead of getting a mark.
  - No longer free once per session.

- **Magic**

  - Works like "real like magic" - occult traditions, goethia, etc.
  - Consequences are **bad**.

- **Hacking**

  - Characters can hack devices and networks with an action roll and a hacking terminal.
  - Often, are stopped by ICE.
