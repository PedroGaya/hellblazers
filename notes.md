# Overall

- Fiction prompts are good after mechanics. However, they don't substitute examples.
- Game has a lot of structure, makes it hard to grok.

# What Is Grimwild?

- Introduce the crew early.
- "Characters are revealed through play"
- "We want you to make your life hard, because that's fun"
- "It's a TV show"

# Getting Started

- Safety Tools are good.

# Gameplay Overview

- Introducing barrage of terms is risky.
- Add a better overview of structure.
- "Open the door wide for collaboration and enjoy the story"
- Mental overhead is large because system is highly coupled.

# Playing With Moxie

- The whole play in good faith is really good.
- Play to tell a story is also really good.
- **"Failure isn't losing, it's just another opportunity to have a great scene"**
- RPG books are _craft books_ aka they must teach you how to be good storytellers.

# Core Rules

- Smooth Flow is good.
- Presentation of dice roll is good.
- Teamwork rules are good.

# Dice Rolls

- Expand on montage rolls
- Defense roll needs examples - There's a null result on a grim and on a perfect?

# Diminishing Pools

- Add examples, then follow-up with exceptions/additional rules.

# Character Details

- Lean on dynamic bonds.

# Creative Freedom

- Zoom-in on tangles as player-driven.
- "Added details must fit your vantage" - impose limits on narrative authority?

# Story Arcs

- Player flags to the GM are good. Lean on this aspect.
- Add these flags to the crew (Reframe goals as beliefs/purpose)

# Damage

- Flag damage as high/low risk.
- Vex is very good, but the spark expenditure is fiddly.

# Recovery

- **Downtime should be paced for drama**.

# Odds & Ends

- Quarrels can be a spark engine. Lean into dynamic bonds?

# Running Grimwild

- Story rolls are good
- Crucibles are hard to read.

# GM Rules

- Suspense is wind-up, Impact is punch. Tension moves bypass this?
- Tiering and framing of moves is good.

# Challenges

- Bonus suspense is good.
- Linked challenges are complex and under-explained.

# Vigilance

- Is good! No comment.

# Combat

- Battlegrounds are unclear - Just challenges?

# Factions

- Factions are too light. Again, just challenges?

# GM With Moxie

- All advice here is good.

# Monsters

- Monster blocks are really, really good. Incorporate with challenges?

# Story Kits

- Very, very good!
