# Getting Started

**_Hellblazers_** is a cyber-fantasy RPG where outcasts take hold of their fates and ride the _synchronicity freeway_ in the only city that matters; Known in its gutters, streets and hearts of its demons as _The Hand_. What lies at the end of your path is anybody's guess – I wouldn't presume to tell you. Dare to step into these neon-covered alleys and you will, undoubtedly, find joy in exploring the fruitful void that waits beyond every turn.

## The Cyber And The Fantasy

_The Hand_ is a nickname for **Port Bastion, Louisiana** - the **world's most important city.** Here, in 22XX, a brutal **technocracy** was born, trampling commonfolk beneath unheard-of wealth and technological might. However, people will always be people, and capital's inability to grasp **intangible humanity** leads to fierce contradiction, and by these forces that be, **the occult becomes manifest**. Such matters of arcane nature are, as they have always been, the domain of **magic**.

Your characters are special, not by birthright or genetics, but by **_ambition_**. **Want something, and all the universe conspires to help you achieve it** - In a world where dreams are manufactured, such authenticity may as well be **literally magic**. To ride the highway of chance, shaped by fate, is to ride the **synchronicity freeway**. What could be the price for such power?

Cast a spell, prepare a ritual, hack the mainframe and yell **_“I’m in”_**, only to end up shooting up the place because you’re terrified of _imps_ you didn’t know existed. You’ll (probably) be fine either way. Such is life in the Hand.

## Things Get Dramatic

**_Your characters are the hub of this game_** - everything revolves around them. During play, you'll create a **crew**, then work together to achieve your personal and group goals. You'll be rewarded for playing into your character traits, complicating the situation, raising the tension, then dealing with the fallout.

**_These characters will be revealed through action._** Lifepaths and _vantage_ do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to minor details. Add setting dressing as needed and focus on the fun of discovering who your character is.

## Things Get Chaotic

**_Dice are violent._** Once they fall, **possibilities die**, collapsing into one. Life in the city is unpredictable, and so are the consequences of your actions - Embrace this as a rare opportunity to delight in the unknown and to make it dramatic all the while.

**_The fun is meant to be shared._** At the table, you have at your disposal one of the greatests sources of mystery in our lives: The minds of others. Let them into the game, and a maelstrom of interesting ideas will emerge from your collective choices. These ideas would've never existed otherwise and are unique to your table - **_Use this_**.

## Things Get Cinematic

**_Lean into the rules._** They provide you with a strong framework for drama and overall great scenes. Things will flow smoothly as actions are quickly resolved and paced. Allow yourself to play your part and the game will do the rest.

**_Your game is a TV show._** It's probably messy, overly long and littered with production problems, but it's great television nonetheless. When playing, think of the current _scene_ - Where's the _spotlight_? How can I make this better? How can we transition to the next scene? Play by the rules and it'll feel like a movie, and you should _flow_ with it.

## Things Get Cyber-Fantastical

**_Stuff gets fantastical._** Here, the intangible is made manifest - First, through your characters ambition and the **synchronicity freeway**. And then there's _everything else_; From fairies of myth to hell and its demons. Ghosts, wizards, occult orders. These things were hidden for a while, suppressed by capital, but under such immense pressure, **humanity cracked**, and our demons once again returned.

**_Stuff gets cyber._** The neoliberal state, ruled by capital, is subservient to its needs. And so, when the world's first **tech trillionaires** came to power, governments turned into **fascist technocracies**. Oligarchies rule with _cybermight_ - Everyone gets mandated government cyberware and the police does whatever it wants with high-tech weapons. Trade secrets drive megacorps to war and AI makes the world worse for everyone under climate crisis. Standard stuff, really.

# Core Rules

## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 dice (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the **outcome** - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim result is cut by a **_thorn_**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_ - the worst case scenario comes to pass.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster.

A normal roll is +0t/_tough_. The GM adds thorns with their _gut feeling_, given the situation. They can make it +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_. If it's at +3t, the task can't be done - break it up into steps or try a new approach.

If needed, the GM can assess difficulty factors to determine how many thorns to add:

- **Intrinsic**: Scale, opposing skill, numbers...
- **External**: Environment, training, tools...
- **Intangible**: Strong feelings, bad information, a curse...

**Damage** to a PC also adds thorns to a roll, but they don't count towards making it _impossible_.

### Smooth Flow

If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can **keep things moving** - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.

## Fate

_**Fate** represents your character's capacity to ride the synchronicity freeway._ It's a d6, you can have up to three at a time and can **spend** them to:

- _**Get +1d on a roll**_ - Supernatural effort, coincidences;
- _**Introduce a fact** to the fiction as **coincidence**_ - Something that just happened to be true and that affects the scene;
- _**Cheat death**_ - Avoid an instance of **physical harm** and take a **mark** instead.

You can earn fate by introducing **complications**, playing towards your goals and beliefs, getting into quarrels, etc.

## Tension

_When you spend fate and twist reality, it builds **tension**_ - A shared **diminishing pool** of dice representing accumulated suspense, bad mojos and the incoming price to be paid. If too much tension builds up, reality lashes out, dealing karmic justice. **Add 1d to the tension pool whenever fate is spent.**

**The GM can spend a tension die to prompt an impact move at any time**. Additionally, the GM can _roll the tension pool_ whenever a decision needs to be delegated to luck or unluck.

# Working Together

## Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and bonds as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take suspense instead.

## Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work togetherm the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

## Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effect, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

## Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

# Dice Rolls

## Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, calrifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a defense roll against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls - avoiding danger is already factored into the roll.

## Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

The GM calls for defense rolls when they target you directly with an impact move. On a messy, there's still some trouble, like taking lesser damage, losing the chance to act or being in a worse position.

**_Defense is cinematic - a reaction, out of your hands_**. The GM picks the stat to fit the danger, your PC's likely reaction, vulnerabilities, and what feels right for the moment. This keeps it varied - you can't always use a strong stat.

## Montage Roll

Roll to condense a sequence you don't want to play out in detail, but still want to leave it up to the dice. **_Roll 2d_**, resolving it all as a single action roll, then narrate a few beats. Keep things moving or zoom in on a grim.

If multiple PCs join, **_each rolls 2d and shares the risk_**. Collaborate on the results. 6s on separate rolls don't count towards criticals.

# Diminishing Pools

## Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When triggered, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

The size of a pool is **4d**/_short_, **6d**/_mid_, or **8d**/_long_. At **0d**, an event occurs, a situation ends or a resource is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fiction - if a pool and the fiction don't match up, adjust or scrap the pool.

- If not dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect**. If the roll was only 1d, you can instead **push yourself** to drop the last die.

- **Drop** 1d from the pool before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so, you have potency or you take the _greater effect_ critical bonus. This stacks.

Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations, usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below.

**_Note_**: _Pools are always notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in italics_.

### Timer Pools

Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.

### Danger Pools

Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.

### Task Pools

Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.

### Resource Pools

Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.

## Power Pools

The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

# Creative Freedom

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?.

**Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

### Details

Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - _and limitations!_ - for roleplaying. They are player _(not GM)_ tools. When unsure of your PC's actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to _give it weight_ and _clearly convey_ the change to the other players.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, circumstances change how your character is able to deal with the world. In these cases, your vantage shifts up or down - These shifts are **_advantages_** and **_disadvantages_**, respectively.

A drunk character, for example, might struggle with things they usually don't - They're at a _disadvantage_ due to inebriation, and what would usually be a given is now a stretch. Similarly, heightened focus or proper tools - things that provide an _advantage_ - might improve your situation from a reach to a stretch.

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.

## Story Twists

If you want introduce story details to the fiction that go beyond set dressing, you want to introduce a **_twist_**.

When adding details, avoid overriding rolls or contradicting the established fiction. If your details affect other PCs or are a bit of a reach, always ask for permission and discuss with the group. The GM has veto power if things get out of hand and can always make a tension roll to see if the twist has the intended effect.

### Complications

Character-driven "tangles" you add to a scene and have to follow-up on. They must stem from your character details and always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unwise decisions_** your PC would likely make.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Trouble_** from beliefs or backstory.

In short, your character's attitude and history introduce previously unseen difficulties. **Whenever you introduce a complication, drop a tension die and take it as fate**.

### Coincidences

Facts added to a scene that significantly change the situation in any way. Like with complications, these must be tied to your character details and/or immediately shift your vantage. **To introduce a coincidence, spend fate and add it to the tension pool**. These are things like:

- **_Character_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting_**: History, geography, factions...

# Character Creation

Characters are not born out of thin air in the middle of nowhere. They have a birthplace, an upbringing and different walks of life - **life paths**.

Each life path includes six professions, granting unique stats and wises. Turning points tell you how you left the first path for the second, then finally how you left the second and found your crew.

## Upbringing

- **Age**: Start at 16 y/o.
- **Stats**: Start with 1 in each.
- **Social Class**: Roll 2d, pick one and increase its indicated stats.
- **Birthplace**: Roll 2d, pick one. After, roll 2d and pick a block.
- **Resources and Lifestyle**: Set them as indicated by your social class.

## Life Paths

- **Path**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Profession**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources**: Add the listed amount to your character sheet.
- **Lifestyle**: Modify it by the indicated amount.
- **Stats**: Increase indicated stats by one.
- **Wises**: Note down your three wises, or create your own.
- **Equipment and Cyberware**: Spend your resources to buy what you want _and_ what is required of you.
- **Age**: Roll 2d, choose 2 to add to age.
- **Turning Point**: Roll 2d, pick one.

Repeat for the second life path.

### Debts

During character creation, you may be required by certain professions to have certain pieces of cyberware or expensive equipment. Of course, **you have to pay for these**. If you can't, choose a different profession or work with your GM to create a debt-holder NPC, then add a **debt** bond to your character sheet to acquire what you need.

## Finishing Up

- **Talents**: Choose one whose pre-requisites you meet.
- **Age**: Roll 2d and choose one or both to add to your age, representing your time before finding a crew.
- **Traits and Desires**: Choose two that match your character and one that doesn't at all.
- **Features**: Detail three distinctive outward features of your character.
- **Bonds**: Write or roll one for each PC.
- **Beliefs**: Write at least one and up to three.

## Archetypes

Instead of building a character from the ground up, you can use an **archetype**. Each has specific rules on how to create your character, and they all output a character of a certain kind. If you just want to quickly build _a type of guy_, choose the appropriate archetype.

# Character Details

## Background

Your upbringing and life paths - the core of your vantage. Each path gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage, as well as a profession to call your own.

## Traits

Use your background to choose 3 that strongly define you and 2 that definitely don't. Why are you like this?

## Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

## Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart.

## Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 4/_excellent_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

## Bonds

Your dynamic with other characters. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other character, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes fate_**.

Bonds can also be made with NPCs. **When you form a bond with an NPC, _take fate_**. Relationships with NPCs don't need an intensity or nature - simply note the type of relationship you have, as well as their name. For example, you may have a debt to a loan shark.

## Beliefs

Written statements of your characters ambitions or goals, doubling as your priorities as a player for this character. Write at least one and up to three.

Beliefs are fluid, actionable and tied to the situation at hand, as well as your character details. As goals are achieved and your character changes, so will your beliefs. **_When you resolve a belief, take fate_** then write a new one.

## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

### Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's assets and investments - a home, expensive equipment.

To increase it, add resources to your **stash** at a one to one ratio. You can retrieve resources from your stash at a 1 to 2 ratio - you get one resource per two stash. Your life style increases according to the following table:

| Resources Invested | Lifestyle | Social Status                              |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 0-10               | 0         | Destitute, homeless, corporate slaves      |
| 11-20              | 1         | Part-time workers, small-time gangoons     |
| 21-40              | 2         | Small business owners, blue collar workers |
| 41-80              | 3         | White collar workers, cops                 |
| 81-160             | 4         | Corporate chieftains, big-time gangoons    |
| 161-320            | 5         | Nouveau riche, mobsters                    |
| 321+               | 6+        | **Not you.**                               |

## Experience

### Post-Session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level _(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)_. This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** _(about 1 in 4)_. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it (also applies to crew XP).

### Vote XP

During **downtime**, players can vote on characters to earn bonus XP. To earn those votes, roleplay towards your beliefs, traits, features, etc. and overall contribute to an enjoyable session.

# Equipment

## Tools Of The Trade

You're assumed to have the gear and skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**.

## Loadout

Loadout is a means of changing your vantage by way of specific equipment. Characters have six **loadout slots**, two of which are occupied by each of your profession's **tools of the trade**. Each equipment slot is used for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of heavy weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might give you an advantage (or disadvantage) for any reason.

Items that don't affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just take note of them in your character sheet.

## A Matter Of Style

Your character's equipment and what they carry is a big part of how they are seen and desire to be seen. Regardless of other **features**, your loadout is invariably a part of your look.

## Stash

Your character's stash is where they store their _stuff_. Generally a safe hiding place, or at home. Aside from **invested resources**, your stash stores any equipment you may have.

# Cyberware

The world of Hellblazers is one rule by transhumanist thought. Why settle for unintelligent design?

Each character has **four slots** for installing cyberware. Each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots (one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**), as well as a type and a price in resources.

## Mechanical Cyberware

Baseline material improvements to the body - barely digital, if at all. Includes things like reinforced bones and tendons, subdermal armor and motion dampeners.

## Neuralinked Cyberware

These interact with the nervous system through a **biodigital interface**, usually installed at birth, in the nape. Includes things like a biomonitor, external connection ports and cyber-eyes.

## Biodigital Interfaces

Interacts directly with the nervous sytem using an advanced AI chip and sensors - Works by translating neural noise from the spine into computable data, and is powered by biological processes.

Once the motherboard interface is installed, most of its components can be changed or upgraded, including better AI, more computational power, internet connectivity, etc.

## Bodily Impact

These monikers do not refer to mass, but rather how impactful each is on the body's natural systems. As a short-hand, all neuralinked cyberware, including the interface, is heavy cyberware, and mechanical parts are light.

### Neurodrugs

These drugs facilitate the process of installing new cyberware, helping the body recognize the interface and other systems as a proper organs. Taken for a period at birth or first installs.

Taken outside of those conditions, neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity**, boosting the amount of available slots. In this case, they are often viciously addicting and taken out of necessity.

If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to a lack of neurodrug intake), the user starts **crashing out**.

### Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

24h after the beginning of the first stage, one of six things may happen:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity.

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and rehab if necessary.

# Damage

## Marks

Lesser damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. **_Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark._**

If a stat is already marked, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take the related **harm**. Note that a mark can be taken even if you have the related harm.

Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you **push yourself**.

## Harm

A hard hit your mind or body, general damage that doesn't need to be tracked in detail. **_This is the default damage from an impact move_**.

- Physical damage leaves you **bloodied**
- Mental damage leaves you **rattled**

Like marks, **_Bloodied and rattled each inflict +1t on all rolls under their stat_**, but don't clear after the roll. Getting bloodied or rattled a second time leaves you **dropped** - you're out of the scene. Make a tension roll to see if you're just out temporarily, take a condition, or wind up dead.

Although bloodied and rattled are the default, especially dangerous attacks with **high risk** can lead straight to dropped, while **low risk** situations might leave you with a mark by default.

A messy defense roll leaves you with lesser damage - dropped becomes bloodied, rattled becomes a mark.

Sometimes, harm under a stat may affect rolls on another - being rattled may make concetrating on a fight much harder. When the fiction calls for it, the GM may apply thorns from a type of harm into a roll under another, as "spill-over".

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

**_You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions_**. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. **_You can also spend spark to take vex in place of rattled_**, if it fits the situation. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response. Your PC is _driven by emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun, what fits the story and the struggle/_difficulty_ of being vexed. After the response, which always takes a beat or two, clear the vex.

## Healing

**_When you get bloodied or rattled, start a 4d pool_** to track its healing. When you **heal** harm from rest, treatment, or another source, roll the pool. At 0d, clear the harm. **_Treatment_** requires _time, tools, training_ and carries risk, and each pool can benefit from treatment only a single time.

**_Marks can't benefit from treatment_**. They are light enough already that only time heals them. They can only be cleared with rest, talents or rolling.

## Scars

As characters go about their lives, they're bound to get hurt. Get hurt enough times and you change.

Whenever you survive an otherwise lethal or traumatic situation, or would gain a permament or long-lasting condition, you may also add a new **trait** or **anti-trait** to your character sheet.

# Crew Creation

## Crew Type

Choose one from:

- Occult Investigators
- Shady Arcane Cult
- Cyber-Terrorists
- Illegal Gas-Biker Gang
- Scrappy Losers Stuck Together

## Triggers

Choose four XP triggers from your crew type, or write your own.

## Improvements

Choose as two from the list provided by your crew type. Use this time to take a look at a map of Port Bastion and pick a place for your lair.

## Reputation

Determine your starting reputations based on improvements and lair.

## Special Ability

Choose one from your crew type, or one from any crew type if playing Scrappy Losers.

# Crew Details

## Crew Type

An archetypal crew, ranging from occult investigators and shady cultists to terrorists, illegal gas-bikers and scrappy losers stuck together.

## Triggers

Four evocative phrases which determine how the crew gains XP. Usually set by the chosen crew type. When triggers are hit, XP is gained immediately.

## Improvements

Assets that can be purchased with resources. Represent better shared equipment and lair - it's material goods. Overall, they improve downtime activities and defend the crew from adversity due to entanglements.

## Reputation

Ranging from -3 to +3, with escalating benefits and consequences. At -3, you're at **war** and enter a **crisis**. At +3, they'll help you out in this war.

## Entanglements Table

Some consequences are only felt later. They are registered in your crews **d20 entanglements table**, representing all manner of things that can happen to you during downtime. Managed in secret by the GM.

## Special Abilities

You work better together; Your special abilities determine _How?_, and should match your group's fantasy of _excelence_. What does your success as a group look like? Your special abilities help you get there.

# The Play Cycle

If you think of the game as a movie, play alternates between action scenes and moments at ease, where characters go about their business and set things up before the next “big thing” happens. In game, we alternate between free play, the action and downtime. During free play, characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed. When the group is ready, we get to the action; Everyone gets together to enact a plan, get down to business. We then shift to downtime, dealing with the fallout of said business, as well as enjoying some leisure time for diverse activities. Once we’re done, we shift back to free - play and start the cycle again.

This is not a rigid structure, but rather a conceptual model to help you organize the game. In truth, while some characters enjoy leisure downtime, some character might start a fight in a bar and get kidnapped. While everyone else scrambles (or not) to figure out what happened, we shift focus between the group and the poor “unlucky” sod. Once everyone is set on what to do, we get back to the action.

Every rule before has been about the characters and the action; How do we do things? Now we use to downtime to see what happens next.

## Downtime

While players work on **downtime activities** spread over **cycles**, the GM deals with **fallout**. When everyone is done with their downtime activities, or if otherwise prompted, free play begins once again.

A downtime cycle refers to the minimum amount of leisure time available for PCs to engage with activities. Activities take an amount of time measured in cycles, **not actual time**. The length of time available in a cycle should be settled on by the group. By default, a handful of days, so that there are two cycles in a week. In play, the standard downtime phase amounts to **two cycles**.

### Crisis

Sometimes, however, you can’t afford all that time. These are times of **crisis**, during which the amount of available cycles is halved. Crisis can be entered as an extreme consequence or when at war with a faction (-3 rep).

## Fallout

### Entanglements

The GM then makes a _tension roll_, where each dropped dice **prompts an impact move from the entanglements table**. Each entanglement describes a thing that happens to the crew – some thugs annoy you, the cops come to interrogate you or other mistakes come running back. The GM may also spend tension to choose a move from the table and prompt it immediately.

The GM may bring any one these moves into play immediately, hold them off until appropriate or make them as **faction moves** (so long as they're made against the players). In any case, if the prompted moves are not dealt with by the end of downtime, then the GM banks them as tension.

Once prompted by the table, these moves cannot be skipped. The GM decides whether or not to cross them out from the table once resolved - some events only make sense as a one-time occurence, while cops being annoying is an all-the-time worry.

#### Editing The Table

Every table starts with a predetermined set of events by the crew type, and there are two ways of editing it:

- **Skipping Impact Moves**: Whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you may add it to an empty slot in the table, or if full, replace an old entry.
- **Spend Tension**: Immediately add an impact move to the table. Do this at any time during free play, or during downtime but before any rolls are made.

Don't attempt to add an entire scene as an entry - keep it punchy. List the move's name and a simple evocative description. Entaglements are not the whole story, they're narrative seeds sowed at the table, reaped only when rolled or otherwise prompted again.

## Downtime Activities

As soon as downtime starts, clear all marks and burned fate slots, roll all healing pools and reset per-session talents and special abilities. Then, each player goes about as many activities as available to them.

- **Recover**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise unwind. Roll any relevant healing or condition pool once, then spend one resource per dice dropped.
- **Acquisition**: Peruse and purchase _improvements_ or _equipment_ not covered by your lifestyle rating.
- **Commune**: Shared time with the crew. Spend crew xp for special abilities, run _character votes_ for bonus XP and updating your character traits and bonds.
- **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool according to the size of the work, as well as determining what happens when cleared. Roll it when working.
- **Circles**: The GM makes tension roll to create an NPC according to the player's needs and vantage.

# Odds & Ends

## Potency

The ability to pull off _jaw-dropping_ feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore thorns from difficulty (_but not from other sources like damage_) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A **potent feat** can do things like:

- **_Group action_**: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.
- **_Stretching Limits_**: Something just beyond normal human limitations.
- **_Mystical_**: Feats that don't fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.

Potency is only concerned with difficulty. It makes a normally +3t/_impossible_ roll possible at +0t. On a +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_ roll, you take _greater effect_ (critical). On a +0t roll, you automatically succeed.

There's a _gray zone_ between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.

## Buffs

Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.

## Quarrels

Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don't waste time debating! **_First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel_**. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. **_Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins_**. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.

The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are **final** — it's okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner's direction. **_Both sides take fate._**

## Push Yourself

Expend extra effort to activate certain talents that require it. After using the talent, **_mark a related stat_** (_your choice_) or **_burn a fate slot_**.

## Interrupt

Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.

## Always

If you have the ability to **_always_** succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true **_unless_** the GM makes a **Counter** move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. _In short, "always" means 95% of the time._
