# Moves

**_The rules that you, the GM, play by_**. While reality is whimsical, it still has its rules. Use these moves to twist and shape in response to the players:

- **_Tension moves_** help the players out in some way **or** escalate the situation. **_Generate tension when used._** _Make these moves with good timing._
- **_Impact moves_** deal significant consequences, crank up the danger, and make the world feel powerful. _Make these moves when prompted._

## Prompt

A trigger for you to make an impact move, caused by things like grim or messy action rolls, a relevant depleted pool, unaddressed foreshadowing, or by spending tension.

## Tension

When PCs ride the synchronicity freeway, they don't do so at no cost - **_Twisting reality builds tension_**. While players require _fate_, as GM, you are empowered to do so as you please with **tension moves**. In any case, you **generate tension** when reality is manipulated in these ways, and you can spend tension at any time to _prompt an impact move._ When making moves, always remember to...

## Keep The Story Moving

While _tension moves_ and _impact moves_ allow you to play at (and as) the world, remember that you are building a narrative as a group - and a cinematic one at that. Player actions drive the story, and **story moves** nudge them forward. That doesn't mean the world is passive — you can describe anything happening that makes sense. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, it's more satisfying when the players have **_fair warning_** about trouble. They know actions have consequences and built-up tension will come back to bite them. This feels fair, so outside of these you give them the initiative. It shows things aren't arbitrary — **_the GM is also playing the game, just by different rules_**.

### Foreshadow

**Hint at trouble, sometimes with a timer pool. Prompts a later impact move.**

_Foreshadow_ to signal upcoming threats and give the players a chance to react. This is a great way to introduce adversity when you don't have or want to spend tension. If they fail to deal with it or ignore the danger, it prompts an impact move and the pace of the story picks up.

### Question

**Ask provocative questions to stir up drama or flesh out the world.**

_Question_ players to help suss out what kind of story they're interested in, share the creative load, and keep the story fresh for yourself. Try to keep this focused on their character's perspective, but feel free to dip into the meta channel here and talk directly as players about what you all want to see play out in game.

### Set The Scene

**Use a tension roll to determine how a scene starts off when it’s unclear.**

_Set The Scene_ when you're unsure about the specifics of the current fiction or want to dive straight into the action. Skip detailed planning and cautious leadups that often drag gameplay down. Instead, jump straight into the action, an in medias res shot of things already in motion! The roll sets the opening mood and stakes for the scene. On a 6, it can even trigger an impact move, kicking things off with a bang and raising the suspense right away.

### Spotlight

**Focus attention on a PC, encouraging them to act or follow-up.**

_Spotlight_ PCs to help direct the action, ensure no one is left out, and put focus where it's needed. This prompts players towards action. Mix in cinematic language like "We cut to..." or "The camera pans over to show..." as you use the "camera", your group's shared imagination space. Cut back and forth between PCs and scenes to build tension and avoid focusing on a single PC for too long.

### Wrap It Up

**Call for a montage roll or jump to a likely conclusion to a scene.**

_Wrap It Up_ when a scene has served its purpose, grown stale, or feels like a foregone conclusion. Don't waste game time on these. Closing these scenes out decisively keeps the narrative tight and focuses on what's next.

## Hit With Impact

### Consequences

What happens when things go wrong — from failed rolls, timers, or impact moves. They should feel **_hard but fair_**, reflecting the stakes and severity of the situation. Every roll carries risk; otherwise, assume success and move on.

Damage is a solid baseline: in a fight, injuries leave you bloodied by default. Other consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There’s no strict formula — _it’s a gut feeling_. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction its teeth.

### Splitting It

Breaking big consequences into smaller ones. Multiple effects can be just as effective and make more sense in the situation. You might break up bloodied into a few marks, or rattled becoming vex and rolling a pool instead. Splits make the story move in multiple directions.

### Spreading It

Hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who didn't prompt the move. Consequences can be identical, vary in severity, or differ entirely. If a PC other than the one prompting it is hit, they get a defense roll. Spreads make the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.

### Thinking Offscreen

Fallout that happens beyond the immediate action. Not all consequences need to occur in the spotlight. Hitting elsewhere builds suspense, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. These unseen events make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.

### Using Pools

Building pressure with danger or timer pools. Start or roll a danger or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often **_offscreen_**. These create looming threats and situations the PCs want to avoid or mitigate. They build pressure and offer a strong alternative to skipping the move and generating tension.

### Setting Risk

Framing danger when it's not the default. Most rolls assume meaningful consequences. Declaring high risk before a roll or situation signals severe stakes—death or worse looms. Low risk shifts outcomes into lighter territory, rolling for things you'd normally skip, with softer consequences. It's a tool for tone, moving between intense and light play.

### Leave It To Fate

Sometimes, shit happens. To avoid delegating such unfortunate circumstances, make a _tension roll_ and interpret the results. On a messy or grim, you can use the dropped dice to spread the consequences and/or as an indication of severity.

### Skiping It

When nothing comes to mind, skip the impact move and generate tension instead! You can also skip impact moves by prompt of a talent, _Lucky Breaks_, etc. In any case, whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you **build tension**, and **you may add the skipped impact move to the crew's entanglement table**.

## Tension Roll

The GM rolls the tension pool to delegate a decision to pure luck, using either its results as a roll and/or the amount of dropped dice to guide the fiction. In general, results are unfavorable to the players, proportionally to how many dice were dropped.

# Tension Moves

In the world of Hellblazers, magic is a cruel mistress that gives as much as it takes. As players can twist reality to their favor by spending fate, the GM can muck up reality in whatever direction they wish by using these moves. Tension keeps the world active when things stall - When your supply of tension runs dry, you can use these to jumpstart the action again. However, use them carefully — **_overuse_** can get frustrating for players, so pick your spots. But **_timely_** use makes good sense.

## Lucky Break

**Resolve a problem the PCs face, use sudden exposition to connect some dots or skip an impact move.**

_Break_ a scene when players are stuck, backed into a corner, or a scene feels dull. It provides a quick out and moves the story forward. Normally, it would feel like an unearned freebie, the tension you gain makes it a fair trade. Never use it when players are engaged — save it for when it's needed.

## Bargain

**Propose an interesting bargain to a PC. Take tension only if they accept.**

_Bargain_ with a player by proposing a juicy twist for their PC. Push **_dilemmas_** and **_drama_** towards their character details. The players pick them because they want the choices that come with! When you have a great idea, propose a bargain for a PC. Remember you only gain tension if they accept, so it's up to you to make the offer irresistible. Don't push hard — this mechanic is built to respect player agency. Don't punish for saying no.

## Bad Omen

**Give fate to each PC, then give a brief vignette before upcoming action.**

_Give them a bad omen_ to focus in tight on your PCs, and to create moments stage for major events. These vignettes that set the scene, whether a quiet campfire scene or tense moment before a battle, give players a chance to add depth and feeling to their characters that might get overlooked, and the "**_free_**" fate they gain lets them know that what's ahead is going to be a real challenge.

# Impact Moves

Deliver hard-hitting consequence that challenge PCs and push the action forward. They require prompting, so when you use them, they're sure to be justified and fair, codified into the rules. They've had fair warning and should have an idea of the risks. So when you make a move, make sure it has **IMPACT** to ensure the choices leading to them matter and the world feels powerful.

When not prompted by a roll, impact moves made directly against a PC give them a defense roll. Some talents also give the ability to interrupt impact moves, possibly negating them. If the roll to interrupt is a messy, you either generate tension or keep it if you spent it to prompt the move.

## Complicate Things

**Escalate a situation, introduce a new problem, or pressure a bond.**

_Complicate Things_ to add twists and elevate drama. Use it when things feel too stable or you want things to be even more chaotic than they already are. It's also great for adding a thorn to a roll by introducing sudden environmental obstacles, a great outlet for built-up tension that doesn't introduce new drama.

## Counter

**Deny things a PC can always do or negate something they did.**

_Counter_ to make the world tenaciously formidable, showing that it won't just roll over. You can stop anything a PC does, including successful action rolls, talents they "always" have permission to use and extra vigilance. If they use a talent that costs them resources, they generally don't have to expend that resource (your call) but can't quickly use it again. However, this can never be used to stop defense rolls and criticals — **don't steal their thunder**. Be careful, players get frustrated if their victories and advantages are snatched away, so use it in interesting ways and make sure the spotlight works its way back to them after you take advantage of the moment.

## Force A Choice

**Present tough options, with room to only choose one.**

_Force A Choice_ to present stark, binary decisions that they can't wiggle their way out of. This move offers no easy way out. When you use it, make sure to follow through without softening the impact. This adds a real cinematic edge, reflecting the truly difficult decisions protagonists must face.

## Hit 'Em Hard

**Inflict damage on a PC, like bloodied, rattled, vex, marks, or a condition.**

_Hit 'Em Hard_ when you need to inflict direct consequences. Whether it’s damage, betrayal, or loss, this move underscores the seriousness of the situation. It's a heavy reminder that the world pushes back against their actions. When you use it, you should be hitting them just as hard as they're trying to hit the world.

## Lock It In

**Declare something occurs, closing off immediate attempts to change it.**

_Lock It In_ to definitively close off an opportunity and close out a scene that's threatening to drag on. Players can be tenacious and keep trying to find some way to not be defeated. This puts a definitive end to a situation. It makes follow-up attempts impossible, which refocuses players' attention forward rather than trying to find yet another way to attempt something they've already failed at.

# Vigilance

The assumed alertness of the PCs, avoiding overly cautious gameplay to keep the focus on the action.

**_PCs are always considered to be as vigilant as their vantage allows_** when dealing with hidden dangers like _traps_, _lies_, or _secret doors_. However, this doesn't mean they are always aware of hidden threats. Instead, the GM uses a gut feeling to decide how much the PC perceives based on their vantage and the type of tension the GM wants to build.

Each of the three levels of vigilance creates a different dynamic in the scene, a different view of PC competence and the danger of the world. These three levels are: **hint**, **reveal**, and **strike**.

## Hint

_Foreshadow_ with a subtle clue about a hidden element. **_The player_** gets a single chance to interpret the situation. They're limited to just one to highlight the natural response of the PC and to keep things flowing. **_Player intuition guides the story forward._** A correct response leads to a reveal or possibly bypasses the situation entirely.

## Reveal

_Foreshadow_ with an obvious unveiling of an immediately imminent threat. **_The PC_** that becomes aware has one chance to react before the danger strikes. **_Character competence guides the story forward._**

## Strike

Make an impact move as the danger immediately strikes them. **_The GM_** assumes the PCs were not vigilant enough. **_The dangerous world guides the story forward._**

# Challenges

A framework to represent **_tasks_**, **_obstacles_**, **_enemies_**, and scenarios that have greater tenacity and complexity than a single action can accomplish. **Challenges** allow you to track progress towards them, but also proactively oppose the PCs. Each has a **_task pool_** to represent its tenacity or complexity. They can also have:

- **Traits**: Qualities they have with strong narrative impact, inflicting thorns, denying permissions, or changing vantage.
- **Moves**: Suggested _impact moves_ they might make. These are examples, not limitations.
- **Fail States**: A trigger that signals the challenge failed, like a competing timer pool or a specific event. It prompts _Lock It In_.

Interpret these short, evocative phrases as fit the situation. Keep your own created challenges similarly brief and flexible. Some uses:

- Create a dangerous enemy or exceptionally tough task.
- Zoom in on pivotal moments.
- Zoom out to collapse related tasks into one objective.
- Turn a broad concept into an actionable objective.

## Building Challenges

1. **_Assign a task pool_** (4d, 6d, 8d) for its tenacity.
2. **_Add traits_** (1 or 2) that shape the situation. Skip the obvious _(storm is windy)_ and highlight what matters _(strong winds are blinding)_. Keep them brief and evocative.
3. **_List short, punchy moves_** (2 or 3) with flexible interpretations. These are examples, not limits. You can spend tension to trigger them, or trigger these when an impact move is prompted by something else.
4. Define a fail state, a specific trigger that prevents that challenge from being accomplished. Avoid obvious outcomes _(dying in a fight)_ and focus on what creates suspense and drama _(breaking a code of honor)_. Players should know the fail state unless mystery is part of the fun — and even then, make it clear one is in play.

**Note**: _Not all of these parts are needed for a challenge._

## Using Challenges

Challenges are for moments of narrative importance. They make whatever you assign them to a proactive element in the story. Use them to spotlight what's happening — not because it's harder, but because it deserves proper screen time and presence. Introduce challenges at times like:

- An impact move is prompted.
- You _Foreshadow_ to give them fair warning.
- You _Complicate Things_ without warning.
- The PCs head straight towards trouble on their own.

## Linked Challenges

**Linked challenges** are greater, more complex interactions, like epicly powerful enemies or unbelievably tense social situations. Each part of the whole has its own proactive presence in the scene. Give them traits that prompt impact moves, triggered by the fiction for dynamic interactions.

## Examples

- **8d | _Boss Guy_**
  - **Traits**: _Ruthless_
  - **Moves**: _Big Weapon_, _Command Subordinates_
  - **Fail States**:
    - _He Gets What He Wants_

# Factions

Between sessions, track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:

- **Resources** that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and capital.
- **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a **faction pool**, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events (impact moves) in the story.
- **Agendas** that represent their ambitions and philosophy, as well as **representatives** that embody and push these agendas.
- **Tiers** that abstract the scale of their power and influence.

Keep 4-6 active factions, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals. Replace factions that are no longer relevant to the story.

## Faction Turn

Once per session, but between sessions, the GM resolves a **faction turn**. Each faction at play gets to make as many faction moves as its tier, simultaneously.

## Faction Moves

### Make A Play

To make a play, for any given faction, roll **any faction pool at play**, so long as it's not a secret one - Factions can not only advance their goals, but support other factions in theirs as well. Instead of rolling, the faction may also use this move to set as many goals as they want.

When a faction pool depletes, the goal is either accomplished or they make their move against another faction, with a montage roll in their favor determining how it plays out. Goals can be anything from stealing/destroying an asset or setting up further action by dropping dice from other pools.

### Acquire An Asset

Spend **faction resources** to gain new assets, expanding the faction's vantage or providing special abilities. Alternatively, they may spend (10 \* 2^New Tier) resources to consolidate power and increase in tier.

### Defend Or Delay

Add a die to **any other faction pool at play**, delaying it.

### Collect

The faction gains as many resources as its tier, plus one.

## Campaign Pools

Timers that pace long-term events across sessions. They work like faction pools but don’t require faction details. Use them to signal upcoming events or remind you to reintroduce plotlines.

# Combat

## Combat Kit

GM tools to create dynamic **_antagonists_** and **_combat scenarios_** quickly. **Tier** is an opponent's threat level. **Role** is a keyword used to guide its behavior in battle to vary its tactics. **Battlegrounds** make the environment a proactive or obstacle-ridden part of the scene. Mix these for dynamic combats. **Encounter** types represent typical ways in which combat happens.

### Tiers

- **Mook**
  - Mostly just _set dressing_.
  - One action roll can take out several.
  - Large groups can be a task pool.
- **Tough**
  - A typical, dangerous enemy.
  - One action roll can take out one of them.
  - Small groups can be a task pool.
- **Elite**
  - Strong scene presence.
  - A 4d/6d challenge.
  - Often leads a group of lesser enemies.
- **Boss**
  - Commands the scene.
  - A 6d/8d challenge or linked challenge.
  - Extremely powerful and versatile.

### Roles

- **Brute**
  - Tough and strong. Must be dealt with, but are immobile.
- **Artillery**
  - Easy to beat, low mobility. Effective from any range, can focus fire.
- **Infantry**
  - Cannot be easily ignored. Protects others. Blocks movement.
- **Striker**
  - Only goal is to do as much damage as possible. Fragile and mobile.
- **Trickster**
  - Do whatever needed to advance their group's goals.
- **Leader**
  - Improves the performance of the whole group, but weak on their own.

### Battleground

Make the location an important, proactive part of the scene. Identify environmental elements to bring into play.

- **Features**: Elements likely to impact, usually complicating, the ongoing action. _They have a strong effect on vantage and difficulty_.
- **Threats**: Hazards that present extra dangers. They may repeat on a timer pool, or be static impact moves. _They have a strong proactive presence in the scene_.

### Encounters

- **Patrols**
  - Weak groups on fixed routes whose goal is to warn others of trouble.
- **Scouts**
  - Roaming groups that seek trouble. Aim to disrupt and flee.
- **Guards**
  - Stationed in key positions. Can warn others or deal with problems themselves.
- **Reserves**
  - Stationed in barracks or similar, await trouble to act. Often occupied.
- **Specialists**
  - Strong groups optimized for a singular goal.

#### Boss Fights

Must have great variation in tactics, roles and battlegrounds, as well as pre-defined "win" and "lose" conditions for all parties involved. May include a boss-tier enemy, or a similarly effective group of other enemy types.

## Running Combat

When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.

**_There's no turn order._** The GM describes the impending danger in the current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world's actions flow from what they do. You make enemies more proactive by _Foreshadowing_ events and following up after, or spending tension to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.

**_Battles occur in the theater of the mind_**, using the group's shared imagination to keep track of each participant's fictional positioning to map fiction to rules. However, using **_battlemaps_** or sketching maps with minis or markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone's imagination aligned. Don't get caught up in detailed tracking — update the map with big changes.

### Combat Rulings

You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps. However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:

**Movement**: Moving usually accompanies another action — the goal isn't just to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the way, it needs an action roll.

**Weapons**: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear imbalance.

**Melee combat**: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.

**Ranged combat**: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.

**Defense Rolls**: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with Agility, blocked with Brawn, anticipated with Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.

**Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1 before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability is required to attack at all.

**Ranged vs. Melee**: Precise ranged attacks demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.

#### Morale

Most enemies are not willing to die or make great sacrifices in a fight. Before combat starts, when enemy numbers are reduced by half, or when the fight is close to over, the GM may decide to have enemies give up due to morale.

#### Initiative

If you want a more structured way to change the spotlight, use these variants of token initiative:

##### Regular

Give each players **two tokens**, which they can spend at any time to _seize the spotlight_ and do a beat (usually an action roll). Once everyone spent their tokens, the situation changes and everyone gets their tokens back. The GM interjects at will.

##### Scrambles

Each player adds **two tokens** to a bag, and the GM adds a _round end token_. Players take tokens out of the bag and act accordingly. If the round end token is pulled, the GM changes the situation and everyone puts their tokens back into the bag. The GM interjects at will, or adds their own tokens to the bag.
