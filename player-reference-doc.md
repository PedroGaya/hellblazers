# Core Rules

## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the outcome - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim result is cut by a **_thorn_**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster. Thorns go from 0t (tough task) to 3t (impossible task).

## Fate

_**Fate** represents your character's capacity to ride the synchronicity freeway._ It's a d6, you can have up to three at a time, and can **spend** them to:

- _**Get +1d on a roll**_ - To account for supernatural effort, _protagonist power_;
- _**Introduce a fact** to the fiction as a **story twist**_ - Something that just happened to be true and that affects the scene;
- _**Cheat death**_ - Avoid an instance of **severe damage** (becomes regular).

## Tension

A shared **diminishing pool** of dice representing accumulated bad karma. **Add 1d to the tension pool whenever fate is spent.**

**The GM can spend a tension die to prompt an impact move at any time**.

## Working Together

### Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and **bonds** as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take tension instead.

### Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

### Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

### Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

## Dice Rolls

### Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, clarifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a **defense roll** against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls.

### Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

### Tension Roll

The GM rolls the tension pool to delegate a decision to pure luck, using the amount of dropped dice to guide the fiction (can be both). In general, results are unfavorable to the players, proportional to how many dice were dropped.

## Diminishing Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When **triggered**, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

- **Timer Pool**: Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.
- **Danger Pool**: Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.
- **Task Pool**: Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.
- **Resource Pool**: Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.
- **Power Pool**: The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect** - You can also always drop the last die in a task pool.

# Creative Freedom

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?. **Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Your vantage can expand or diminish along the scale. These shifts are called **_advantages_** and **_disadvantages_**, respectively.

- Guaranteed - Given - Stretch - Reach - Impossible
- Always - Should - Could - Scarcely - Never

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. **Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage is set dressing**; Like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense. Similarly, **any details that do not significantly shift vantage are set dressing**.

There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing.

## Story Twists

If you want introduce story details to the fiction that go beyond set dressing, you want to introduce a **_twist_**:

### Complications

Character-driven **disadvantages** you add to a scene and have to follow-up on. They must stem from your character details and always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unforeseen consequences_** of your actions.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Trouble_** from beliefs or backstory.

**Whenever you introduce a complication, drop a tension die and take it as fate**.

### Coincidences

Character-driven **advantages** you add to a scene. Like with complications, these must be tied to your character. These are things like:

- **_Character details_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene details_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting details_**: History, geography, factions...

**To introduce a coincidence, spend fate and add it to the tension pool**.

# Character Creation

Characters start with two life paths - Each includes six professions, granting unique stats and wises. Turning points tell you how you left the first path for the second, then finally how you left the second and found your crew.

## Upbringing

- **Age**: Start at 16 y/o.
- **Stats**: Start with 1 in each.
- **Social Class**: Roll 2d, pick one and increase its indicated stats.
- **Birthplace**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources and Lifestyle**: Set them as indicated by your social class.

## Life Paths

- **Path**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Profession**: Roll 2d, pick one.
- **Resources**: Add the listed amount to your character sheet.
- **Lifestyle**: Modify it by the indicated amount.
- **Stats**: Increase indicated stats by one.
- **Wises**: Note down your three wises, or create your own.
- **Equipment and Cyberware**: Spend your resources to buy what you want _and_ what is **required** of you.
- **Age**: Roll 3d, choose 2 to add to age.
- **Turning Point**: Roll 2d, pick one.

Repeat for the second life path.

### Debts

During character creation, you may be required by certain professions to have certain pieces of cyberware or expensive equipment. Of course, **you have to pay for these**. If you can't, choose a different profession or work with your GM to create a debt-holder NPC, then add a **debt** bond to your character sheet to acquire what you need.

## Finishing Up

- **Talents**: Choose one whose pre-requisites you meet.
- **Age**: Roll 2d and choose one or both to add to your age, representing your time before finding a crew.
- **Traits**: Choose three that match your character and two that don't at all.
- **Features**: Detail three distinctive outward features of your character.
- **Bonds**: Write or roll one for each PC.
- **Beliefs**: Write at least one and up to three.
- **Resistances**: Each is a diminishing pool of size equal to the sum of its paired stats.

## Archetypes

Instead of building a character from the ground up, you can use an **archetype**. Each has specific rules on how to create your character, and they all output a character of a certain kind. If you just want to quickly build _a type of guy_, choose the appropriate archetype.

# Equipment

You're assumed to own the **tools** and have the skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**.

## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

## Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's investments or other signifiers of income. To increase it, spend your resources in **assets**, such as expensive equipment or a home. Each increases your lifestyle rating by one.

| Lifestyle | Affordable Stuff                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | A shot of shitty liquor. Food for a day.    |
| 1         | Rent in a shanty town. Minor amenities.     |
| 2         | Out-of-date smartphone. Home repairs.       |
| 3         | Short trips. Black market firearms.         |
| 4+        | Rent in the good side of town. Investments. |

## Loadout

Loadout is a means of changing your vantage by way of specific pieces of gear. Characters have five **loadout slots**, two of which are occupied by each of your profession's given tools, if any.

Each equipment slot is used for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of heavy weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might change your capabilities for any reason. Some particularly annoying to carry items may occupy two slots instead of one.

Items that do not affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just take note of them in your character sheet.

## Cyberware

Each character has **five slots** for installing cyberware. Like with equipment, each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots proportional to its impact on the body - one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**.

### Neurodrugs

Neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity** and allow for cyberware installation. can be viciously addicting. If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to neurodrug abstinence), the user starts **crashing out**.

### Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

The first stage usually lasts 24h, after which roll 2d and pick one:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity.

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and any necessary rehab.

# Health

## Resistance Pools

Whenever a character takes **physical damage**, drop a die from their physical pool for **regular** damage, or roll it if the damage is **severe**. Similarly, whenever a character would take **mental damage**, do the same for the mental pool. The GM determines the severity of the damage.

| The "Accident"                          | The Severity                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| _Fall from great height. Getting shot._ | Roll physical pool.         |
| _A sucker punch. Tear gas._             | Drop 1d from physical pool. |
| _Witnessing gore. A really bad trip._   | Roll mental pool.           |
| _Rejection. Relentless mockery._        | Drop 1d from mental pool.   |

Depleting a pool leaves you **dropped** - out of the scene, for any reason. The GM will then tell you _how much_ **fallout** you take (at least one, up to three). Choose whatever makes the most sense from:

- Getting **vexed**;
- Taking a **condition**;
- Getting a **scar**;

If you only have one die left in the pool when you take any damage, drop it instead of rolling the pool.

### Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**. Interpret the response, which always takes a beat or two, then clear the vex. If you get dropped and take vex, then your choice of vex explains why your character is out of the scene.

### Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. Can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible. Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

### Scars

Change any character detail and mark it as a scar. You can:

- Strain a **bond**;
- Embody an **anti-trait**;
- Shift a **belief**;
- Gain a **feature**;

If appropriate, you may also break or destroy **equipment** and **cyberware**.

### Long-Term Afflictions

**_Players have final say on any long-term conditions and scars._** In these cases, work with the GM to find a good fit your your PC and the situation. This includes **character death**.

## Death

Death does not come unwarranted - it must be clearly understood as a possibility from the get go. Whenever you're about to take damage, the GM may indicate it as **lethal damage**. If you are dropped by lethal damage, the GM makes a tension roll under a cup - Once someone checks your body, **if _any_ dice are dropped**, your character is dead.

## Fate

Whenever you spend fate to get bonus dice, cheat death or introduce coincidences, add it to the tension pool. You can earn fate in the following ways:

- **Introduce a complication**: As seen above. In this case, take a tension die as fate.
- **Change your character details**: Take fate whenever:
  - When you complete a personal objective or see your outlook change, **changing a belief**;
  - **Shift a bond** in an envolving relationship with a PC;
  - **Take a scar** due to fallout;
  - etc.
- **Roll a disaster**: Take fate whenever you roll a disaster.
- **Hit a crew XP trigger**: When a trigger is hit, all characters take fate.

# Crew

## Crew Creation

Choose an archetype from:

- Occult Investigators
- Shady Cult
- Cyber-Terrorists
- Illegal Gas-Biker Gang
- Scrappy Losers Stuck Together

Each provides a procedure for setting it up. In general:

- **Triggers**: Choose four XP triggers from your crew type, or write your own.
- **Improvements**: Choose as two from the list provided by your crew type. Also pick a place for your lair.
- **Reputation**: Determine your starting reputations based on improvements and lair.
- **Special Ability**: Choose one from your crew type.

## Triggers

Four evocative phrases which determine how the crew gains XP. Usually set by the chosen crew type. When triggers are hit, mark them as so and each character takes fate.

## Improvements

Assets that can be purchased with resources. Represent better shared equipment and lair - it's material goods. Overall, they improve downtime activities and defend the crew from adversity due to entanglements.

## Reputation

Ranging from -3 to +3, with escalating benefits and consequences. At -3, you're at **war** and enter a **crisis**. At +3, they'll help you out in this war.

## Entanglements Table

Some consequences are only felt later. They are registered in your crews **entanglements table**, representing all manner of things that can happen to you during downtime. Managed by the GM.

## Special Abilities

You work better together; Your special abilities determine _How?_, and should match your group's fantasy of _excelence_. What does your success as a group look like? Your special abilities help you get there.

# Downtime

While players work on **downtime activities** spread over **cycles**, the GM deals with the entanglements table and factions. When everyone is done with their downtime activities, or if otherwise prompted, free play begins once again.

A downtime cycle refers to the minimum amount of leisure time available for PCs to engage with activities. Activities take an amount of time measured in cycles, **not actual time**. The length of time available in a cycle should be settled on by the group. By default, a handful of days, so that there are two cycles in a week. In play, the standard downtime phase amounts to **two cycles**.

## Entanglements

The GM makes a _tension roll_ where each dropped dice **prompts an impact move from the entanglements table**. Entanglements describes a thing that happens to the crew – some thugs annoy you, the cops come to interrogate you or other mistakes come running back. The GM may also spend tension to choose a move from the table and prompt it immediately.

The GM may bring any one these moves into play immediately, hold them off until appropriate or make them as **faction moves** (so long as they're made against the players). In any case, if the prompted moves are not dealt with by the end of downtime, then the GM banks them as tension.

Once prompted by the table, these moves cannot be skipped. The GM decides whether or not to cross them out from the table once resolved - some events only make sense as a one-time occurence, while cops being annoying is an all-the-time worry.

### Editing The Table

Every table starts with a predetermined set of events by the crew type, and there are two ways of editing it:

- **Skipping Impact Moves**: Whenever you skip a prompted impact move, you may add it to an empty slot in the table, or if full, replace an old entry.
- **Spend Tension**: Immediately add an impact move to the table. Do this at any time during free play, or during downtime but before any rolls are made.

Don't attempt to add an entire scene as an entry - keep it punchy. List the move's name and a simple evocative description. Entaglements are not the whole story, they're narrative seeds sowed at the table, reaped only when rolled or otherwise prompted again.

## Activities

As soon as downtime starts, clear all marks and burned fate slots, roll all healing pools and reset per-session talents and special abilities. Then, each player goes about as many activities as available to them.

- **Recover**: Go to a doctor, hospital, or otherwise unwind. Recover dice to physical resistance equal to your lifestyle rating (minimum of one).
- **Acquisition**: Peruse and purchase _improvements_ or _equipment_ not covered by your lifestyle rating.
- **Commune**: Shared time with the crew. Spend all xp, clear triggers, and run _character votes_. Recover all mental resistance.
- **Work**: The GM sets a diminishing pool according to the size of the work, as well as determining what happens when cleared. Roll it when working.
- **Contact**: The GM makes tension roll to create an NPC according to the player's needs and vantage.

## Crisis

During times of **crisis**, the amount of available cycles is halved. Crisis can be entered as an extreme consequence or when at war with a faction (-3 rep).

# Hacking

As a concept, hacking can be done to **devices** and **networks** utilizing an action roll and a **terminal**. By making clever use of the tools the terminal provides, hackers can bypass **ICE** - Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics, or to put simply, programs made to stop hackers.

The hacking roll one of _wits_, and starts with up to _4t_, **depending on ICE level**. These thorns can be lost by accumulating _advantages_:

- Having proper vantage;
- Using good hardware;
- Special daemons and programs;
- Talents or special abilities;

Each advantage applies only once per category (no double dipping).

## Operations

Sometimes, hacking a system is an on-going effort (like in heist movies). Start a diminishing pool of any size and drop one dice per advantage, then make action rolls to trigger the pool until it is cleared and the op is done.

The difficulty for each action roll in an operation is determined as with regular hacks, but the worst result in any such roll "sticks" as the overall result for the operation.

## Intrusions

ICE is the main form of digital security, and it works by:

- **Restricting connections** between devices;
- **Deploying counter-measures** against hackers;

ICE may place protection of _both_ remote connections, physical connections, or neither. It provides different levels (1 to 4) of protection, with each adding _thorns_ equal to its level to any hacking attempt in the protected device or network.

## Countermeasures

_Any ICE, once bypassed, is no longer effective._ However, **regular ICE** evolves over time - once some time has passed, the program _learns_ from the hack and increase its security level. _Succesful_ hacks and ops avoid this by being stealthy.

**Black ICE** works the same, but employs more destructive countermeasures by counter-hacking the offending device itself - glitching it, inducing overheating, stealing data or, in the case of **biodigital terminal cyberware**, attacking the hacker directly by frying their interface.

## Electronics

Both **devices** and **(sub) networks** of devices can be hacked. Hackers can use their hacking terminal to access devices remotely, so long as they're both in the same network or connected physically. Hacking a network grants access to all devices within it, but usually requires an _operation_.

Isolated devices are usually connected to each other or command centers through physical connection lines, forming a completely isolated sub-net. This necessitates on-premise access for hacks.
