# Combat

## Combat Kit

GM tools to create dynamic **_antagonists_** and **_combat scenarios_** quickly. **Tier** is an opponent's threat level. **Role** is a keyword used to guide its behavior in battle to vary its tactics. **Battlegrounds** make the environment a proactive or obstacle-ridden part of the scene. Mix these for dynamic combats. **Encounter** types represent typical ways in which combat happens.

### Tiers

- **Mook**
  - Mostly just _set dressing_.
  - One action roll can take out several.
  - Large groups can be a task pool.
- **Tough**
  - A typical, dangerous enemy.
  - One action roll can take out one of them.
  - Small groups can be a task pool.
- **Elite**
  - Strong scene presence.
  - A 4d/6d challenge.
  - Often leads a group of lesser enemies.
- **Boss**
  - Commands the scene.
  - A 6d/8d challenge or linked challenge.
  - Extremely powerful and versatile.

### Roles

- **Brute**
  - Tough and strong. Must be dealt with, but are immobile.
- **Artillery**
  - Easy to beat, low mobility. Effective from any range, can focus fire.
- **Infantry**
  - Cannot be easily ignored. Protects others. Blocks movement.
- **Striker**
  - Only goal is to do as much damage as possible. Fragile and mobile.
- **Trickster**
  - Do whatever needed to advance their group's goals.
- **Leader**
  - Improves the performance of the whole group, but weak on their own.

### Battleground

Make the location an important, proactive part of the scene. Identify environmental elements to bring into play.

- **Features**: Elements likely to impact, usually complicating, the ongoing action. _They have a strong effect on vantage and difficulty_.
- **Threats**: Hazards that present extra dangers. They may repeat on a timer pool, or be static impact moves. _They have a strong proactive presence in the scene_.

### Encounters

- **Patrols**
  - Weak groups on fixed routes whose goal is to warn others of trouble.
- **Scouts**
  - Roaming groups that seek trouble. Aim to disrupt and flee.
- **Guards**
  - Stationed in key positions. Can warn others or deal with problems themselves.
- **Reserves**
  - Stationed in barracks or similar, await trouble to act. Often occupied.
- **Specialists**
  - Strong groups optimized for a singular goal.

### Boss Fights

Must have great variation in tactics, roles and battlegrounds, as well as well defined "win" and "lose" conditions for all parties involved. May include a boss-tier enemy, or a similarly effective group of other enemy types.

### Morale

Most enemies are not willing to die or make great sacrifices in a fight. Before combat starts, when enemy numbers are reduced by half, or when the fight is close to over, the GM may decide to have enemies give up due to morale.

## Running Combat

When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.

**_There's no turn order._** The GM describes the impending danger in the current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world's actions flow from what they do. You make enemies more proactive by _Foreshadowing_ events and following up after, or spending tension to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.

**_Battles occur in the theater of the mind_**, using the group's shared imagination to keep track of each participant's fictional positioning to map fiction to rules. However, using **_battlemaps_** or sketching maps with minis or markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone's imagination aligned. Don't get caught up in detailed tracking — update the map with big changes.

### Combat Rulings

You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps. However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:

**Movement**: Moving usually accompanies another action — the goal isn't just to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the way, it needs an action roll.

**Weapons**: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear imbalance.

**Melee combat**: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.

**Ranged combat**: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.

**Defense Rolls**: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with Agility, blocked with Brawn, anticipated with Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.

**Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1 before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability is required to attack at all.

**Ranged vs. Melee**: Precise ranged attacks demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.

#### Initiative

If you want a more structured way to change the spotlight, use these variants of token initiative:

##### Regular

Give each players **two tokens**, which they can spend at any time to _seize the spotlight_ and do a beat (usually an action roll). Once everyone spent their tokens, the situation changes and everyone gets their tokens back. The GM interjects at will.

##### Scrambles

Each player adds **two tokens** to a bag, and the GM adds a _round end token_. Players take tokens out of the bag and act accordingly. If the round end token is pulled, the GM changes the situation and everyone puts their tokens back into the bag. The GM interjects at will, or adds their own tokens to the bag.
