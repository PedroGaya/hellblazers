# Impact Moves

Deliver hard-hitting consequence that challenge PCs and push the action forward. They require prompting, so when you use them, they're sure to be justified and fair, codified into the rules. They've had fair warning and should have an idea of the risks. So when you make a move, make sure it has **IMPACT** to ensure the choices leading to them matter and the world feels powerful.

When not prompted by a roll, impact moves made directly against a PC give them a defense roll. Some talents also give the ability to interrupt impact moves, possibly negating them. If the roll to interrupt is a messy, you either generate tension or keep it if you spent it to prompt the move.

## Complicate Things

**Escalate a situation, introduce a new problem, or pressure a bond.**

_Complicate Things_ to add twists and elevate drama. Use it when things feel too stable or you want things to be even more chaotic than they already are. It's also great for adding a thorn to a roll by introducing sudden environmental obstacles, a great outlet for built-up tension that doesn't introduce new drama.

## Counter

**Deny things a PC can always do or negate something they did.**

_Counter_ to make the world tenaciously formidable, showing that it won't just roll over. You can stop anything a PC does, including successful action rolls, talents they "always" have permission to use and extra vigilance. If they use a talent that costs them resources, they generally don't have to expend that resource (your call) but can't quickly use it again. However, this can never be used to stop defense rolls and criticals — **don't steal their thunder**. Be careful, players get frustrated if their victories and advantages are snatched away, so use it in interesting ways and make sure the spotlight works its way back to them after you take advantage of the moment.

## Force A Choice

**Present tough options, with room to only choose one.**

_Force A Choice_ to present stark, binary decisions that they can't wiggle their way out of. This move offers no easy way out. When you use it, make sure to follow through without softening the impact. This adds a real cinematic edge, reflecting the truly difficult decisions protagonists must face.

## Hit 'Em Hard

**Inflict damage on a PC.**

_Hit 'Em Hard_ when you need to inflict direct consequences. Whether it’s damage, betrayal, or loss, this move underscores the seriousness of the situation. It's a heavy reminder that the world pushes back against their actions. When you use it, you should be hitting them just as hard as they're trying to hit the world.

## Lock It In

**Declare something occurs, closing off immediate attempts to change it.**

_Lock It In_ to definitively close off an opportunity and close out a scene that's threatening to drag on. Players can be tenacious and keep trying to find some way to not be defeated. This puts a definitive end to a situation. It makes follow-up attempts impossible, which refocuses players' attention forward rather than trying to find yet another way to attempt something they've already failed at.
