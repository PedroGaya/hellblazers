# Creative Freedom

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?.

**Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

### Details

Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - _and limitations!_ - for roleplaying. They are player _(not GM)_ tools. When unsure of your PC's actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to _give it weight_ and _clearly convey_ the change to the other players.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, circumstances change how your character is able to deal with the world. In these cases, your vantage shifts up or down - These shifts are **_advantages_** and **_disadvantages_**, respectively.

A drunk character, for example, might struggle with things they usually don't - They're at a _disadvantage_ due to inebriation, and what would usually be a given is now a stretch. Similarly, heightened focus or proper tools - things that provide an _advantage_ - might improve your situation from a reach to a stretch.

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.

## Story Twists

If you want introduce story details to the fiction that go beyond set dressing, you want to introduce a **_twist_**.

When adding details, avoid overriding rolls or contradicting the established fiction. If your details affect other PCs or are a bit of a reach, always ask for permission and discuss with the group. The GM has veto power if things get out of hand and can always make a tension roll to see if the twist has the intended effect.

### Complications

Character-driven "tangles" you add to a scene and have to follow-up on. They must stem from your character details and always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unwise decisions_** your PC would likely make.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Trouble_** from beliefs or backstory.

In short, your character's attitude and history introduce previously unseen difficulties. **Whenever you introduce a complication, drop a tension die and take it as fate**.

### Coincidences

Facts added to a scene that significantly change the situation in any way. Like with complications, these must be tied to your character details and/or immediately shift your vantage. **To introduce a coincidence, spend fate and add it to the tension pool**. These are things like:

- **_Character_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting_**: History, geography, factions...
