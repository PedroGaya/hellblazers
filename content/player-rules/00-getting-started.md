# Getting Started

**Hellblazers** is a cyber-fantasy RPG where outcasts take hold of their fates and ride the _synchronicity freeway_ in the only city that matters; Known in its gutters, streets and hearts of its demons as _The Hand_. What lies at the end of your path is anybody's guess – I wouldn't presume to tell you. Dare to step into these neon-covered alleys and you will, undoubtedly, find joy in exploring the fruitful void that waits beyond every turn.

## The Cyber And The Fantasy

_The Hand_ is a nickname for **Port Bastion, Louisiana** - the **world's most important city.** Here, in 22XX, a brutal **technocracy** was born, trampling commonfolk beneath unheard-of wealth and technological might. However, people will always be people, and capital's inability to grasp **intangible humanity** leads to fierce contradiction, and by these forces that be, **the occult becomes manifest**. Such matters of arcane nature are, as they have always been, the domain of **magic**.

Your characters are special, not by birthright or genetics, but by **_ambition_**. **Want something, and all the universe conspires to help you achieve it** - In a world where dreams are manufactured, such authenticity may as well be **literally magic**. To ride the highway of chance, shaped by fate, is to ride the **synchronicity freeway**. What could be the price for such power?

Cast a spell, prepare a ritual, hack the mainframe and yell **_“I’m in”_**, only to end up shooting up the place because you’re terrified of _imps_ you didn’t know existed. You’ll (probably) be fine either way. Such is life in the Hand.

## Things Get Dramatic

**_Your characters are the hub of this game_** - everything revolves around them. During play, you'll create a **crew**, then work together to achieve your personal and group goals. You'll be rewarded for playing into your character traits, complicating the situation, raising the tension, then dealing with the fallout.

**_These characters will be revealed through action._** Lifepaths and _vantage_ do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to minor details. Add setting dressing as needed and focus on the fun of discovering who your character is.

## Things Get Chaotic

**_Dice are violent._** Once they fall, **possibilities die**, collapsing into one. Life in the city is unpredictable, and so are the consequences of your actions - Embrace this as a rare opportunity to delight in the unknown and to make it dramatic all the while.

**_The fun is meant to be shared._** At the table, you have at your disposal one of the greatests sources of mystery in our lives: The minds of others. Let them into the game, and a maelstrom of interesting ideas will emerge from your collective choices. These ideas would've never existed otherwise and are unique to your table - **_Use this_**.

## Things Get Cinematic

**_Lean into the rules._** They provide you with a strong framework for drama and overall great scenes. Things will flow smoothly as actions are quickly resolved and paced. Allow yourself to play your part and the game will do the rest.

**_Your game is a TV show._** It's probably messy, overly long and littered with production problems, but it's great television nonetheless. When playing, think of the current _scene_ - Where's the _spotlight_? How can I make this better? How can we transition to the next scene? Play by the rules and it'll feel like a movie, and you should _flow_ with it.

## Things Get Cyber-Fantastical

**_Stuff gets fantastical._** Here, the intangible is made manifest - First, through your characters ambition and the **synchronicity freeway**. And then there's _everything else_; From fairies of myth to hell and its demons. Ghosts, wizards, occult orders. These things were hidden for a while, suppressed by capital, but under such immense pressure, **humanity cracked**, and our demons once again returned.

**_Stuff gets cyber._** The neoliberal state, ruled by capital, is subservient to its needs. And so, when the world's first **tech trillionaires** came to power, governments turned into **fascist technocracies**. Oligarchies rule with _cybermight_ - Everyone gets mandated government cyberware and the police does whatever it wants with high-tech weapons. Trade secrets drive megacorps to war and AI makes the world worse for everyone under climate crisis. Standard stuff, really.
