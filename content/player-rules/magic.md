## Magic

Magic sources are as such, giving _advantages_:

- Having proper vantage;
- Auspicious dates, places and artefacts;
- Proper guidance and following of explicit instructions;
- Talents or special abilities;

Advantages don't stack with each other (no double dipping).

The scope of what magic can achieve is limited by what "traditional" magic can achieve, including:

- Summoning demons from the Goetia;
- Doing Necromancy;
- Some form of Alchemy;
- Summoning spirits as in Theurgy;
- Wards, prayers and other such protections;

### Spells

All spells are an action roll. This roll starts with _4t_ (can be more due to external factors, for a max of _7t_). The difficulty of the roll can be reduced once for each source of advantage.

### Rituals

All rituals are like spells, but more powerful. Start a diminishing pool of any size and drop one dice per magical source, then make action rolls to roll the pool until it is cleared and the ritual is complete.

The difficulty for each action roll in a ritual is determined as with spells, but the worst result in any such roll "sticks" as the overall result for the ritual. Most rituals can be interrupted at any time to avoid consequences.

### Consequences

Some spells and rituals specifically outline what happens on a messy andor grim, but this is not always true. Most magical undertakings fall under certain categories, each of which has tiered levels of generic consequences, from level 1 to level 4. These are to be used as such, if no other consequences were previously specified:

For both spells and rituals, what happens on a **grim** result is the **worst possible consequence**. For **messy** results, _make a tension roll_, and the severity of the consequences shall be proportional to the dropped dice, following the "shapes" outlined by the category of magic at hand.

The GM can _spend tension_ to make the severity and type of consequence of any mistakes made in a magical undertaking **_strictly worse_** or to **_force a tension roll_**.

### Improvisation

Characters can explicitly follow the instructions for a spell or ritual in the fiction as a **rote spell**. _When following a rote_, you (try to) do as the spell tells you, thus counting as proper guidance (_-1t_).

_When_ **_improvising_**, you abstract away the details of the existance, remembrance and execution of the spell, and thus, no bonus can be gained from proper guidance. The feasibility of improvistion is determined by vantage, and it has no bearing on the difficulty of the spell.

Players may take note of any spells/rituals and commit them to their character sheets as something their character _knows and remembers_ or into a _grimoire_ of sorts. In such cases, you can always cast this spell as a rote, so long as the fiction allows (don't lose the grimoire, not blackout drunk, etc).
