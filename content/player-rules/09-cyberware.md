# Cyberware

The world of Hellblazers is one rule by transhumanist thought. Why settle for unintelligent design?

Each character has **five slots** for installing cyberware. Like with equipment, each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots proportional to its impact on the body - one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**.

## Biodigital Interfaces

They interact directly with the nervous sytem using an **advanced growth-type chips and sensors** - It works by translating neural noise from the spine into computable data, and is powered by biological processes. Albeit costly, they can be upgraded.

### Neurodrugs

These drugs facilitate the process of installing new cyberware, helping the body recognize the interface and other systems as a "proper organs". Usually taken for a short period after birth or during gestation.

Taken outside of those conditions, neurodrugs also **temporarily increase cyberware capacity**. In this case, they are often viciously addicting. If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to neurodrug abstinence), the user starts **crashing out**.

### Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

The first stage usually lasts 24h, after which one of six things may happen:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity.

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and rehab if necessary.
