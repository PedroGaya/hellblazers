# Cyberware

The world of Hellblazers is one rule by transhumanist thought. Why settle for unintelligent design?

Each character has **four slots** for installing cyberware. Each piece of tech has an associated cost in slots (one slot for **light** cyberware, two for **heavy**), as well as a type and a price in resources.

## Mechanical Cyberware

Baseline material improvements to the body - barely digital, if at all. Includes things like reinforced bones and tendons, subdermal armor and motion dampeners.

## Neuralinked Cyberware

These interact with the nervous system through a **biodigital interface**, usually installed at birth, in the nape. Includes things like a biomonitor, external connection ports and cyber-eyes.

## Biodigital Interfaces

Interacts directly with the nervous sytem using an advanced AI chip and sensors - Works by translating neural noise from the spine into computable data, and is powered by biological processes.

Once the motherboard interface is installed, most of its components can be changed or upgraded, including better AI, more computational power, internet connectivity, etc.

## Bodily Impact

These monikers do not refer to mass, but rather how impactful each is on the body's natural systems. As a short-hand, all neuralinked cyberware, including the interface, is heavy cyberware, and mechanical parts are light.

### Neurodrugs

These drugs facilitate the process of installing new cyberware, helping the body recognize the interface and other systems as a proper organs. Taken for a period at birth or first installs.

Taken outside of those conditions, neurodrugs **temporarily increase cyberware capacity**, boosting the amount of available slots. In this case, they are often viciously addicting and taken out of necessity.

If any cyberware ends up using slots that are no longer available (usually due to a lack of neurodrug intake), the user starts **crashing out**.

### Crashing Out

After a small period of excess usage of cyberware, the user enters the first stage of the crash out, with intense headaches, anxiety, dilated pupils and other symptoms of withdrawal.

24h after the beginning of the first stage, one of six things may happen:

- The user goes **catatonic**, entering a vegetative-like stupor.
- The user goes **psycho**, losing control of the self for sporadic periods.
- The user **gets fried** in intense pain, permanently damaging cyberware.
- The user experiences **gradual organ failure**, leading to death.
- The user **slowly develops an incurable neurodegenerative disease**.
- The crash **recedes**, with seemingly increased cyberware capacity.

An ongoing crash can be stopped with intense care, re-introduction of neurodrugs and rehab if necessary.
