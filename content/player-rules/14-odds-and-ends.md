# Odds & Ends

## Potency

The ability to pull off _jaw-dropping_ feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore all thorns (_except_ thorns gained through conditions) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A **potent feat** can do things like:

- **_Group action_**: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.
- **_Stretching Limits_**: Something just beyond normal human limitations.
- **_Mystical_**: Feats that don't fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.

On +0t rolls, you automatically succeed.

There's a _gray zone_ between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.

## Buffs

Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.

## Quarrels

Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don't waste time debating! **_First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel_**. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. **_Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins_**. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.

The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are **final** — it's okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner's direction. **_Both sides take fate._**

## Interrupt

Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.

## Always

If you have the ability to **_always_** succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true **_unless_** the GM makes a **Counter** move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. _In short, "always" means 95% of the time._
