# Hacking

As a concept, hacking can be done to **devices** and **networks** utilizing an action roll and a **terminal**. By making clever use of the tools the terminal provides, hackers can bypass **ICE** - Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics, or to put simply, programs made to stop hackers.

The hacking roll one of _wits_, and starts with up to _4t_, depending on security level. These thorns can be lost by accumulating _advantages_:

- Having proper vantage;
- Using good hardware;
- Special daemons and programs;
- Talents or special abilities;

Each advantage applies only once, per category (no double dipping).

## Operations

Sometimes, hacking a system is an on-going effort (like in heist movies). Start a diminishing pool of any size and drop one dice per advantage, then make action rolls to roll the pool until it is cleared and the op is complete.

The difficulty for each action roll in an operation is determined as with regular hacks, but the worst result in any such roll "sticks" as the overall result for the operation.

## Security

ICE is the main form of digital security, and it works by:

- **Restricting connections** between devices;
- **Deploying counter-measures** against hackers;

ICE may place protection of _both_ remote connections, physical connections, or neither. It provides different levels (0 to 4) of protection, with each adding _thorns_ equal to its level to any hacking attempt in the protected device or network.

_Any ICE, once bypassed and until it is replaced, is no longer effective._ A device may have both device-level and network-level ICE, in which case both need to be surpassed before the hacker can gain access to the device.

### Countermeasures

If a hacker is caught or makes a fatal mistake, regular ICE often either blocks the offending terminal from ever connecting to the network again, or temporarily increasing its security level, or both, and stricter ICE may remove the targetted device from the network entirely.

However, more often than not, hackers make inocuous mistakes that allow them to be traced, or at the very least, alert system administrators of their presence.

**Black ICE** employs more destructive countermeasures by counter-hacking the terminal itself - bricking it, inducing overheating, stealing data or, in the case of **biodigital terminal cyberware**, attacking the hacker directly by frying their interface.

## Tools of the Trade

**Daemons** are specialized AI programs used by hackers and sysadmins alike to automate onerous tasks, such as scanning an entire network. When used as part of security, they're a part of ICE protocols. When used by hackers, they're attack programs purpose built to exploit certain vulnerabilities and systems.

In terms of raw, statistical success rate, they're better than any human. However, they're gatekept by hardware - some things are simply too slow to keep up. Hence, speed matters. Hackers and sysadmins alike employ techniques such as **stenography**, take **performance drugs** and **specialized hardware** for this reason.
