# Character Details

## Background

Your upbringing and life paths - the core of your vantage. Each path gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage, as well as a profession to call your own.

## Traits

Use your background to choose 3 that strongly define you and 2 that definitely don't.

## Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

## Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart.

## Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 4/_excellent_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

## Bonds

Your dynamic with other characters. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other character, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes fate_**.

Bonds can also be made with NPCs. **When you form a bond with an NPC, _take fate_**. Relationships with NPCs don't need an intensity or nature - you may simply note the type of relationship you have, as well as their name. For example, you may have a debt-holder bond to a loan shark.

## Beliefs

Written statements of your characters ambitions or goals, doubling as your priorities as a player for this character. Write at least one and up to three.

Beliefs are fluid, actionable and tied to the situation at hand, as well as your character details. As goals are achieved and your character changes, so will your beliefs. **_When you resolve a belief, take fate_** then write a new one.

## Resources

A collection of loose money, credit and favors, ultimately an abstraction of your character's current purchasing power. Resources are only used for big purchases that represent a significant investment. **Don't sweat the small stuff**. If you think your character can afford something, they probably can.

### Lifestyle

If you are unsure of your character's purchasing power, rely on their **lifestyle stat**. It abstracts the sum total of your character's investments or other signifiers of income. To increase it, spend your resources in **assets**, such as expensive equipment or a home - each increases your lifestyle rating by one.

## Experience

### Post-Session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level _(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)_. This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** _(about 1 in 4)_. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it (also applies to crew XP).

### Vote XP

During **downtime**, players can vote on characters to earn bonus XP. To earn those votes, roleplay towards your beliefs, traits, features, etc. and overall contribute to an enjoyable session.
