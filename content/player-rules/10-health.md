## Resource Pools

Whenever a character takes **physical damage**, drop a die from their physical pool, or roll it if the damage is more severe. Similarly, whenever a character would take **mental damage**, do the same for the mental pool. The GM determines the severity of the damage.

| The "Accident"                          | The Severity                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| _Fall from great height. Getting shot._ | Roll physical pool.         |
| _A sucker punch. Tear gas._             | Drop 1d from physical pool. |
| _Witnessing gore. A really bad trip._   | Roll mental pool.           |
| _Rejection. Relentless mockery._        | Drop 1d from mental pool.   |

Depleting a pool leaves you **dropped** - out of the scene. The GM will then tell you _how much_ **fallout** you take (at least one, up to three). Choose whatever makes the most sense from:

- Getting **vexed**;
- Taking a **condition**;
- Getting a **scar**;

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response. Your PC is _driven by emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun, what fits the story and the struggle/_difficulty_ of being vexed. After the response, which always takes a beat or two, clear the vex.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. Can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

## Scars

Whenever we survive an otherwise lethal or traumatic situation, we change - for good or bad. Change a character detail and mark it as a scar. You can:

- Strain a **bond**;
- Embody an **anti-trait**;
- Shift a **belief**;
- Gain a **feature**;

If appropriate, you may also break or destroy **equipment** and **cyberware**.

## Long-Term

Players have final say on any long-term conditions and scars. In these cases, work with the GM to find a good fit your your PC and the situation. This includes **character death**.

## Death

Death does not come unwarranted - it must be clearly understood as a possibility from the get go. When the time is right, and your character is supposed to die, the GM makes a tension roll. **If any dice are dropped, your character is dead**. Make a new one during the next instance of downtime.
