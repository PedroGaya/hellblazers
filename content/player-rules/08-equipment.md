# Equipment

## Tools Of The Trade

You're assumed to own the gear and have the skills that are a given for your vantage - primarily determined by your **professions**.

## Loadout

Loadout is a means of changing your vantage by way of specific equipment. Characters have five **loadout slots**, two of which are occupied by each of your profession's **tools of the trade**, if any.

Each equipment slot is uesd for items significant enough to change your vantage - Think of heavy weaponry, unusual gear, anything that might change your capabilities for any reason. Some particularly annoying to carry items may occupy two slots instead of one.

Items that do not affect your vantage do not need to be tracked this way - just take note of them in your character sheet.

## A Matter Of Style

Your character's equipment and what they carry is a big part of how they are seen and desire to be seen. Regardless of other character features, your loadout is invariably a part of your look.

## Stash

Your character's stash is where they store their _stuff_. Generally a safe hiding place, or at home. Aside from **assets**, your stash stores any equipment you may have.
